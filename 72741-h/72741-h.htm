<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> a bishop had asked Elsie Carston, “Do you
really and truly believe that islands, in far-off
seas, were made islands and peopled by black races,
solely in order that your brother should govern
them, and you—in his absence—govern his children?”
Elsie would have looked straight into the
eyes of the bishop and would have answered, “I do
not”; but she did.</p>

<p>If Marcus Maitland had been asked by any one,
“Do you really think and believe that God made
the hills in India solely for the preservation of the
white woman’s complexion? that where He did not
make hills He did not mean white women to go?”
Marcus would have answered, “I do”; but he did
not.</p>

<p>So far as Marcus knew, the island chosen for the
future education of his brother-in-law, Eustace
Carston, in the art of governing might have hills.
On the other hand, the faith of some former governor’s
wife might have removed them and taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
them away with her, there being no limit to the
luggaged importance of governors’ wives. Marcus
knew because he had travelled. He had been on
boats where every one was cramped excepting some
governor’s wife and her suite. He had suffered the
indignity of a tropical discomfiture in order that she
might acquire an importance that was as new to her
as was discomfort to him.</p>

<p>If it had not been for Eustace Carston, he had
not travelled. When a man’s only sister marries a
man he does not know, there are left to him but two
things to do—to like him or to leave him alone.
Marcus left him alone: left England. He had meant
to travel until such time as his sister should write
and beg him to come back, but she did not write
and beg him to come back. She wrote at intervals
saying what a delightful time he must be having;
said intelligent things about tropical vegetation;
and wrote, as they came, of charming babies, all exactly
like their father. Marcus thought they should
have been like her and therefore like him; for between
him and his sister there was a strong family
likeness. In Sibyl’s eyes there was no one to be
compared with Eustace Carston. He stood alone.
Marcus was tired of hearing that, so when an
American he met on board ship assured him he was
a white man, and suggested they should go into
business together, Marcus, after making exhaustive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
enquiries about the man and his business,
agreed. And he went to America; there lived and
made money. When he had made as much money
as he wanted, he began to long for home and he
turned his face homewards, taking with him both
the affection of his American friend and an interest
in the business. London was still home to him; so
he settled there and at certain times of the year
turned his thoughts to a moor in Scotland, and
at others to his collection of china, pictures, and
prints, and so he occupied himself—at leisure.
Before he had left England he had begun buying
china. He had since learned how little he had then
known.</p>

<p>On his return to London the only person he
wanted to see was his sister and she was away; and
her children were with their aunt in the country.
If he could have seen the children without seeing
the aunt, he would have done it, but he disliked the
aunt. He wondered what Sibyl would do with the
children when her husband took up his new appointment.
She could not surely ask Carston’s
sister to have them indefinitely.</p>

<p>It must have been suggested to thousands of
bachelor uncles that they should take an interest
in their nephews and nieces. And thousands of
bachelor uncles must have responded by taking an
interest—and more than a life interest—in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
nephews and nieces. The methods of suggestion are
usually two. Either by prayer indirectly, or by an
appeal, made directly, either after church on a
suitable Sunday (the hedges should be white with
hawthorns, and the cows, red and white, should be
knee-deep in buttercups, and if possible a trout
should dart in and out the shallows of the stream);
or at Christmas-time when all churches are decorated
and all relations are demonstrative.</p>

<p>Either appeal would possibly have moved Marcus
Maitland. He was susceptible to environment:
had, no doubt, as a boy, tickled trout, and must
have known something of the meaning of mistletoe.
But of a letter however delicately expressed he
was always suspicious. All letters he read, firstly,
to see what was in them: secondly, to see what was
behind them. In a letter Sibyl told him her husband
had been appointed governor of yet another island
that was as hot as it was remote: which fact she
stated clearly enough. Behind it was the suggestion
that no mother could subject so delicate and delicious
and new a thing as Diana’s complexion to the
ravages of so intemperate a climate.</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Marcus</span>,—Do you feel inclined to take
charge of the child while her parents are governing
wisely and well that far-away island? Diana is delightful.
If you had not gone round the world, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
as a squirrel goes vaguely round and round its cage,
you must have discovered it for yourself.</p>

<p>I want you to have Diana. I could leave her with
Elsie, Eustace’s sister, who is a dear and so proud
of Diana, but she rather resents my having the
child when I am at home. So when I go away this
time I want to leave her with some one else just to
show Elsie I dare. It’s a tremendously brave thing
to do—requiring true courage on my part—but I
must do it because Elsie, having no children of her
own, is centring herself on the child, and I know if
Diana should want to marry, she might try to dissuade
her. So, Marcus, will you have her? Elsie,
dear as she is, is rather too strong-minded a woman
for a girl to be with altogether. She is a little too
earnest and strenuous. I want Diana to frivol. I
don’t want her to see too deeply into the things of
life—yet. Everything with Elsie is spelt with a
capital letter, and is heavily underlined. Woman to
her is so much more than mere woman. I don’t
want Diana at her age to be faced with sex problems.
Dear Elsie is inclined to see in man woman’s
chief and natural enemy. You will understand! She
wants Diana to do great things in life. I want life
to do great things for her. I know you will give her
the chance to see its beautiful side, and, of course,
if there should be a question of her falling in love—as
there is bound to be—you will guide her gently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
to fall in love with the right kind of man—a man
like—dear old thing, you are bristling all over—did
you imagine I was going to say Eustace when I
want to persuade you to do something for me? I
took the child to her first dance last night. She
looked like a rose; her complexion is delicious.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Marcus was glad Diana had a complexion. Was
she pretty? He should say not. When especial mention
is made of a woman’s skin it usually means
that it is the only thing that can with truth be commended.
If everything else is good, the complexion
is thrown in, as it were. Sibyl’s had been delicious,
and he did not remember mentioning it in writing to
any one—not even to his tutor at Magdalen—No!</p>

<p>Marcus returned to the letter. Sibyl was in London
and she had not let him know—that was hard
to forgive; however, she had now made a definite
demand upon him and he must respond. Hitherto
she had asked of him nothing more than an unbounded
admiration of Carston and that he had
been obliged to deny her—on principle. She spoilt
Carston, indulged him, so much so that he would
allow her, expect her even, to follow him to any and
every part of the world regardless of whether the
climate were good or bad for a woman’s delicate skin.</p>

<p>Marcus rang the bell. To the man who answered
it, he said: “Pillar, I am expecting a young lady.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” said Pillar, “I have been expecting
this—”</p>

<p>“Since when?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, at any time during the last eighteen
years the question would not have come upon me
as a shock—I saw her last night. She looked beautiful—if
I may say so, sir, like a rose.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Miss Diana, sir.”</p>

<p>“You saw her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; there was a ball at Rygon House. The
valet is a friend of mine. I looked in. Miss Diana
held her own. She stood out among the disputants.
She excited a certain—a creditable amount of
jealousy, among the right people. It was the opinion,
expressed on the other side of the swing door,
that she should go far.... Yes, sir, she is taller than
her ladyship and, in a sense, fairer. I should say
her hair is hardly golden, although I suspect in sunlight
I should discover myself in error. Her skin is
dazzling.... You will remember, sir, calling my attention
to the skins of the women—in Munich I
think it was?—And her carriage—you will perhaps
remember drawing my attention to the carriage
of the women in—the Andalusian women?
Yes, sir, Andalusian—I think I am correct—How
was she dressed, sir?”</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland had not asked the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“In white, sir. It didn’t look white. I mean, if
you will excuse me, there were many in white, but
Miss Diana looked conspicuous. She might have
been in scarlet—she showed up so—stood <em>out</em>.
I have heard you use the expression with regard to
the paintings of old masters. As we left Madrid, I
think it was, sir, you lamented the lost art of paintrature.”</p>

<p>“That will do, Pillar. Did her ladyship see you?”</p>

<p>“Her ladyship did me that honour, sir. I handed
her a cup of coffee in order to make myself known,
saying, ‘Sugar, my lady,’ if I remember rightly.
Miss Diana took no refreshment. Her ladyship
asked for you, sir; she thought you were not in
town. I told her you had just returned from
Norway.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Pillar; that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Miss Carston comes here, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Pillar took from his pocket a small red notebook,
in which he began to write.</p>

<p>“What is it, Pillar? What are you writing?”</p>

<p>“Awning, sir. So far only awning. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Why awning?”</p>

<p>“The usual accompaniment to a wedding, sir.
It’s as well to get things in hand.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Elsie Carston</span> lived in the country, in the
village of Bestways, and her life she ordered
according to the sojournings abroad of her brother
and his wife. It was for their children—she told
herself and sometimes others—that she lived in
the country; but she knew it was not quite true.
When we deceive ourselves and know it, we are on
the way to salvation. Elsie was undoubtedly on the
way to salvation,—a long way on,—but she did
stop on the way, now and then, to look back. She
liked to feel that if she had not devoted herself to
her brother’s children she would have travelled.
She sometimes allowed people to believe that she
thirsted for deserts and longed to climb camels; but
if those people had seen her in her garden fringing
the skirts of the walks with thrift, and embroidering
the borders with pansies and pinks, they
would not have believed her anxious to leave her
garden and her work. She loved Bestways. Her
house was of warm red brick—Georgian, she
would tell you with pride. It was old, certainly: the
garden that held it in its arms—as it were, hugging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
it—was old too, older than the house possibly.
The yew hedges had been planted by people of
long ago, who perhaps spoke of the day when the
hedges should be grown quite high and they not
there to see. There must always be in a garden that
sadness. Therefore those who have a garden should
also—if they may—have children, whose children
will live to walk under the trees they plant.</p>

<p>Elsie had no children, of course; and she would
have admitted it, if asked the direct question;
otherwise she was inclined to look upon her brother’s
children as hers, and in no way would she have
allowed that they belonged to her sister-in-law’s
brother. It was in her garden they should walk
in years to come, not in his.</p>

<p>At one end of the village Elsie Carston lived.
At the other, back from the road, in a house surrounded
by a large park, with every other evidence
around it of riches—quiet riches—lived Mrs.
Sloane. She walked under trees that had been
planted by Sloanes many years before, and in
church she sat beneath monuments to Sloanes: but
in the pew beside her must sit borrowed children,
there being no little Sloanes. They would, by this
time, have been grandchildren, if there had been.
Though borrowed children are not what they
should be, those would slip their little hands into
Mrs. Sloane’s—one from each side—just as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
they had been real grandchildren, and sit quietly,
longing for the sermon to be done; and if it were
longer than it should be, a little squeeze from the
hand of their old friend would bid them take courage.
She had been a child once and she knew! So
must preachers also once have been children, yet
do they think of the child to whom it is real pain to
sit still? Some do.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane sat in the chancel, and sometimes
into the chancel would come, during the service, a
little bird. Then would the words of the preacher
become winged words and would find their way
into the heart of every child in the congregation.
So robins as well as men may be evangelists.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane and Elsie Carston were great friends.
They were both gardeners, which may make for
friendship. There was between them this difference:
Elsie weeded her garden because in her garden
there were weeds; Mrs. Sloane weeded hers because
to find a weed would have been something of
an excitement—likewise a triumph. Elsie Carston
planted and weeded and watered entirely oblivious
to the hatred that she (aunt to Diana) had aroused
in the heart of Marcus (uncle to Diana). And as
she weeded and watered and planted, it was of
Diana she thought, and she grudged not that far-off
island its flowers and its luxurious vegetation,
because it gave her Diana. She no longer found it in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
her heart to bemoan the sandy soil of her garden
and its unquenchable thirst.</p>

<p>For Diana’s sake she watered the flowers as
much as for their own. Diana loved flowers and
Elsie stooped to pull up a weed that had dared to
push its way into Diana’s border. She stooped
easily, much more easily than Marcus would have
imagined possible. He was pleased to think of her
as middle-aged and crabbed and sour and disagreeable
and grasping, whereas she was thirty-six and
young at that and delightful—easily amused and
a friend to every one in her small world. She was
expecting Diana on a long stay, so there lurked a
smile at the corners of her mouth and a twinkle in
her honest grey eyes. While Eustace was abroad,
Diana would be hers. She was thankful Eustace
had married so devoted a wife. She had known people
express surprise that Lady Carston should
leave her children, suggesting that however much
you love your husband your children should not be
neglected. Sibyl’s children were not neglected, nor
had they ever been. Elsie loved them. Not even a
mother could feel more for them than she felt.
When Dick, the boy, was small she had said to
him, “I wish, Dick, you were mine—my own
little boy.”</p>

<p>“Why?” he had asked, not seeing the necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“Well—because I wish you were.” She had no
better reason to give than this.</p>

<p>“But you have all the feelingship of a mother
towards me,” he had said; and it was true: she
had. What more than the feelingship could she
desire? Not even all mothers possess it. Elsie, as
she watered, wondered how Diana had looked at
the dance; what her mother had thought of her,
what the world in general had thought of her,
what any one man had thought of her. Elsie
frowned, assuring herself that she wished some man
to fall in love with Diana. Of course she did. The
pansies at her feet knew better. They would have
allowed that she was kind and strangely gentle for
one so capable—but of those children, they must
have admitted, she was a little jealous. She would
have “thinned” the children’s relations, on the
other side, just as drastically as she thinned theirs
on both sides of the border. On to the sterling qualities
of a generous nature Elsie had grafted some of
Sibyl’s tenderness. “But,” said Diana, “you can
see where it joins”; but it <em>did</em> join—that was
something; moreover, the soldering held. At twelve
o’clock the second post came in and a letter was
brought out to Elsie. It was from Sibyl, her sister-in-law,
and she opened it thinking here was the
news she had been waiting for—the date of Diana’s
coming. She read the letter, and re-read it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
Then she turned back and read it for the third
time.</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Elsie</span>,—no one dearer,—you know
that. Shall I make you understand what I want you
most desperately to understand? I am more than
grateful to you for all you have done for Diana.
Every time she comes into the room Eustace is
grateful. For much of what she is she is indebted to
you: her frankness, her honesty are yours. Her
goodness, a reflection of yours. Everything, therefore,
that is best in her I acknowledge as your gift
to her, to me, to her father. But, Elsie, I want her
to see something of the world; I want her to have
the amusement a girl of her age should have. I
want her to see men so that she may choose between
them. I want her to stay in London for a few
months and I want to leave her with my brother.
I don’t think you like him? He was a dear to me
when I was Diana’s age and a fierce chaperon.
You have never seen him. He was so long abroad.
I remember you said you had heard things about
him: but they may not have been true, and if they
were—if he is what you call a man of the world—it
will only make him more fiercely particular with
Diana than he would otherwise have been. It is my
fault that he has drifted away from me. He was always
jealous of Eustace. I wonder if you will understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
that? No, you are too generous a nature
to understand anything so small. So, will you
write to Diana and say you are pleased she should
go to London? Because without that she won’t
stay willingly, and I want her to stay willingly.
Marcus would never keep her unless she wanted to
stay. That’s his way. It will be so good for him to
have her. Pillar, his man, says he wants something
young about the house (Marcus, not Pillar). What
have you to do with that? you will say. Don’t
say it. I want you and Marcus to be friends—I
want Diana to see something of the world and the
world to see something of her. There, it’s out!
Worldly woman that I am! You have a literary recluse
at your gate (they are so dangerous when they
come out). I am afraid of him. You have a muscular
parson. I am afraid of him. I am afraid of all men—tinkers,
tailors, soldiers and sailors, rich men,
poor men, apothecaries, and thieves—they are all
thieves. I am afraid of all but the right one.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Your dear Eustace’s Wife</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Elsie pondered over that letter—she was hurt—she
was indignant—beaten—but there was
one to whom she always could turn for comfort—one
who always understood.</p>

<p>“Marcus,” she called, and to her feet came
slithering a black dog, and he lay on his back before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
her, presenting all that was most vulnerable in his
person to the tender ministrations of her wavering
foot. One hind leg, to all appearances, was
broken past mending. One front paw was badly
damaged.</p>

<p>He was asking but the raking movement of his
beloved physician’s well-booted foot and he should
be healed. How long, how long, must he wait?
There were other things to be done all on a summer’s
day. There was a yellow cat—a stranger—not
far off, that needed a lesson. There were more
sparrows than there should be in a good woman’s
garden. They needed a fright, that was all. Low-growing
gooseberries there were within the reach
of the shortest-legged and best-bred spaniel. He
gave up the remote chance of healing by the scraping
up and down of feet, and was off in the wake of
the yellow cat, flushing sparrows as he went. The
brambles did for him what his mistress would not.
But brambles, being self-taught scratchers, have
not the firmness of touch desirable; moreover, they
don’t know when to leave go, or how.</p>

<p>“Marcus, do you hear me when I speak?” called
Elsie.</p>

<p>“He’s that obstinate, that he be,” said the old
gardener, who always came when any one was
called, answering to any name if it were called loud
enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>He was deaf, so it was best to make sure: besides,
his wife had lately died and he felt lonely
if left entirely to vegetables.</p>

<p>“He just does it for the sake of contrariness,”
he went on; “at his age he did ought to know
better—but he don’t mean half he does—if you
don’t take no notice of him he’ll come skeewithering
back.”</p>

<p>And skeewithering back Marcus came, and resting
his head on Elsie’s lap looked up into her face
with that in his eyes that must forever disarm all
feelings of anger, hatred, and malice against uncles—even
uncles!</p>

<p>“Why, oh, why were you called Marcus?” she
asked, and Marcus said, in his own particular manner
of speech, that he had often asked himself the
same question—and would now ask her.</p>

<p>Elsie remembered well the day Marcus had arrived—already
named—in a basket. When she
had opened the basket she had seen the smallest
of black spaniels, and the blackest of black dogs,
whose mother, judging by his neck, might have
been a swan, and whose father, judging by the rest
of him, the best spaniel ever bred. When she questioned
the suitability of his name she discovered
that he looked the wisest thing in the world—that
a philosopher beside him must have lost in seriousness
of demeanour. On his forehead there stood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
strongly pronounced, the bumps of benevolence—so
as Sibyl had named him Marcus, Marcus he
remained.</p>

<p>The other Marcus was then nothing more than
the forgotten name of a negligible brother—the
children’s uncle—on the other side.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Dearest Sibyl,”</span> wrote Marcus, “why
didn’t you tell me you were in London and
taking Diana to her first dance? I had always
meant to give her a pearl necklace for her coming-out
ball. I will take her, of course, while you are
abroad, on one condition, and that is that she
isn’t always rushing off to her aunt in the country.
I dislike that woman, as you know. I dislike all
strong-minded, self-opinionated women. You are
quite right, she is no fit companion for a girl of
Diana’s age. Who has a better right to Diana than
I have? I can’t have Miss Carston interfering.
Sibyl, my dear, I am longing to see you.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he written the words when the telephone
bell rang at his elbow.</p>

<p>He lifted the receiver and heard Sibyl’s voice
telling him he was a darling old owl. In answer to
his gentle reproof she said, Of course she had written
to tell him she was bringing Diana to London,
but she had forgotten to post the letter! Couldn’t
he have guessed that? There was the same tenderness
in the voice there had always been. She used
the same absurd endearments she had always used.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
He knew she must be unchanged. Might she come
and see him? Now? At once? She would!</p>

<p>He put back the receiver—and was astonished
at his emotion. The force of his feelings shocked
him. He had imagined himself past caring for anything
very much. His life was so easy—so well
ordered—so few demands were made upon him,
except for money—and those were easily met.
There was nothing to disturb him—nothing to
excite him—except perhaps now and then a
rather bigger venture than usual in the city—which
as a rule meant more money (he was lucky)
with which to buy china, glass, prints, anything he
liked, and to his manifold likes his room testified.
His house was beautiful and the things in it were
chosen for their beauty. For these things he had
come to care because he had been left alone in the
world. He liked to think of himself as neglected.
He had felt for his sister a deep affection and she
had chosen to marry and leave him.</p>

<p>He couldn’t compete for her love. He never
competed. Even as a collector he had suffered
from this amiable inability to assert himself. Now
he deputed others less sensitive to buy for him. In
his young days, before he had gone to America, he
remembered at an auction losing a vase he had
particularly wanted. He had allowed himself to be
outbidden by a girl with wide, grey eyes—who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
wore dogskin gloves. He could have outbidden her,
but something had moved him to pity. Her gloves
probably—they betrayed such a lack of social
knowledge. It was a blue vase he would have
bought. He loved the colour of it—the feel of it.
She could have known nothing of the feel of it, for
she held it in gloved hands, for which lack of feeling
and understanding he pitied her—pitied her ignorance.
She held the vase upside down to look at
the mark: even about that she was undecided—or
else she was short-sighted, which probability the
clearness of her eyes questioned. Having examined
the mark, she handed the vase back to the man
from whom she had taken it and sharply bid a
figure to which Marcus could have gone if he had
wished. But he had not. So the vase became hers
and she looked him straight in the eyes—and her
eyes said “Beaten!”</p>

<p>“Goth!” thought Marcus as he recalled the
scene. “She held the vase in gloved hands. Vandal—nice
grey-eyed, clean, ignorant woman—” But
he had thought of her oftener than he knew
in those days, bemuse for a certain time he had
thought of her every time he had seen a woman
whose eyes were not grey.</p>

<p>Marcus, thinking now only of his sister, walked
to a mirror that hung on the wall between two
windows and looked at himself anxiously. Would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
she find him changed? At forty-six he was bound to
look different, a little grey, of course. That did not
matter, so long as she was not grey. He lit a cigarette;
then put it down unsmoked, remembering
that as a girl she had hated the smell of tobacco.
Then he went to the window and ran up the blind;
then pulled it down again halfway: not too strong a
light, he decided; and pulled all the blinds down
halfway. It would be kinder to Sibyl. Or should he
pull them right up and face the worst? Leave her
to face the light? A taxi stopped in the street below.
It was absurd, but he was too nervous to go
down and meet her and he counted the seconds it
would take Pillar to get upstairs, to open the door.
One! He must have been waiting in the hall. Supposing
she were grey-haired, old, and wrinkled—or
fat—? How should he keep it from her that he
was shocked, distressed, pained? The door opened
and in a moment two arms were round his neck.
He almost said, “Where is your mother?”—was
delighted he should almost have said it; wished he
had really said it. What prettier compliment could
he have paid this delightful being he held in his
arms?</p>

<p>She was still young—still brown-haired—still
impulsive. He held her at arm’s length—Still in
love with Eustace! He could see that: no woman
remains so young who is not in love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Marcus, Marcus, you dear funny old thing!”</p>

<p>“Why funny?” he asked, gently disengaging
himself from her arms; “let me look at you again.”</p>

<p>With a feeling of apprehension he knew to be
absurd, he looked again, gaining courage as he
looked. Had he overestimated the youthfulness of
her appearance? Did not her pallor detract just a
little from the radiance that had been her greatest
beauty? Had he missed wrinkles? Yes, one or two—finely
drawn, put in with a light hand, emphasizing
only the passage of smiles—nothing more. If
she had lost anything in looks she had gained much
in expression. He might have left the blinds up.
Her eyes were large. There were women he knew
whose eyes got smaller as they grew older; that he
could not have borne. Sibyl’s eyes were just as they
had always been. They had lost naturally something
of their look of childlike questioning. That he
did not mind. The childlike woman he had long
ceased to admire. He read here true womanliness;
a depth of real understanding, and a certain
knowledge of the big things in life—things that
mattered.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” he said, and he drew her down on
to the sofa beside him. “She looked like a rose, did
she?”</p>

<p>“My Diana?”</p>

<p>Marcus nodded. “Pillar saw her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“Did he say she looked like a rose? Well, then
it must have been very evident.”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” said Marcus, unconsciously
championing Pillar. Not that he altogether trusted
Pillar’s taste. He had shown in the Louvre, Marcus
remembered, a weakness for Rubens’s women. He
might have admired the consummate technique of
a great master while deploring a certain coarseness
in his choice of subjects, but he had not done so—</p>

<p>“Is she pretty?” asked Marcus.</p>

<p>“She’s rather delicious.”</p>

<p>“When is she coming to see me?”</p>

<p>“At any moment, but she’s a will-o’-the-wisp.
She comes and goes as she wills.”</p>

<p>“She’s slight, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, slight! You could pull her through a ring.”</p>

<p>Marcus was glad of that.</p>

<p>“Now tell me about your dear self, Marcus.”</p>

<p>There was so little to tell, he said.</p>

<p>“Not when everything interests me—Give me
a cigarette.”</p>

<p>“But you used not to—” he began, handing her
his cigarette case.</p>

<p>“Smoke? No—but Eustace likes me to sit with
him, and we smoke—you get to like it in hot
climates.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t have let you smoke if you had been
mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“No?” she laughed gently. “Dear old Marcus!”</p>

<p>Looking at Sibyl, and finding her so perfectly
satisfying to his artistic sense, he fell to wondering
what Diana was really like. And whom she was
like? He dared not ask. He had no wish to hear she
was like her father. She could not be like her mother
or the papers would be bound to have got hold of it.
He was glad they hadn’t—but still girls far less
pretty <em>were</em> advertised.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” said Sibyl; “it shows you won’t
let Diana.”</p>

<p>“Smoke? No, certainly not.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Diana—I must tell you about
her—a little about her, without saying she is like
her father, is that it?” She laughed—how gay she
was! When she had told him that little, omitting
that much, she asked: “Does she sound nice?”
And Marcus, smiling, said she sounded delicious.</p>

<p>“She is.”</p>

<p>Marcus laughed; this was the old Sibyl back
again, with all her enthusiasms, the same charming
companion she had been as a girl. Because of that
charm of hers, he liked to think, he had not married.</p>

<p>“Sibyl, is she like you?” he asked impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He breathed again.</p>

<p>“And I so wanted her to be like her father,” she
added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose so—Is his sister—the one you
call Elsie—married?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You said she had no children—”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“But naturally. It was hardly necessary to say
it, was it?”</p>

<p>And Sibyl laughed. Marcus needed just what she
was going to give him, a disturbing young thing
to live with him. Marcus dreaded it, although he
would not have said so because of that sister he so
disliked, who wanted Diana.</p>

<p>“I won’t have Diana running off whenever Miss
Carston chooses to send for her. That I think you
understand.”</p>

<p>“But there will be times when you will want to
get rid of her. You won’t want to give up travelling,
will you?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t she come with me?”</p>

<p>“You can’t conceive, dear, the trouble a woman
is travelling. You would hate to have to think of
some one else—another place to find in a crowded
train—another person’s luggage to look after—another
ticket to lose—you would hate it.”</p>

<p>“Then I shan’t travel.”</p>

<p>“But surely it would be easier to send Diana to
Elsie than to do that.”</p>

<p>“I detest that woman—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“She has—nice eyes. You are a dear old thing,
Marcus, and not a bit changed.”</p>

<p>“I never change.”</p>

<p>Marcus waited all day. Diana did not come. He
was disappointed. It showed a want of reverence
for the older on the part of the younger generation.
At last he went to bed with a volume of Rabelais
to read (in order to keep up his French). He read
until he grew sleepy. He put out the light and slept
until a flash of light awoke him and he wondered—What
was this thing sitting on the end of his bed in
white—a being so slim and so exquisite!</p>

<p>“Darling! the same old Marcus,” the being exclaimed,—“so
sleepy and I woke him up. I
couldn’t wait to see him—such years since we
met!”</p>

<p>“Sibyl!” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Not this time, it’s Diana—is she like Sibyl?
I am so glad—well, darling, talk!”</p>

<p>The slim being sat on his bed and sticking out
her feet, on which twin shoe-buckles twinkled,
urged him to amuse her. He dreaded “This little
pig went to market” played through the bedclothes.
He saw Diana eyeing the spot where she
must know his toes were bound to be.</p>

<p>“How did you get here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Pillar opened wide the portal and we walked in.
He wasn’t in the least surprised.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Not surprised?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. He said we might turn up the
carpet and dance—if we liked. He offered us a
gramaphone—his own—to dance to.”</p>

<p>“My dear Diana, you ought to be in bed.”</p>

<p>“Ought? Why?”</p>

<p>“It’s time.”</p>

<p>“What is he reading?” She put out her hand. He
seized the book.</p>

<p>“A bedside classic, is it?”</p>

<p>He put it under his pillow.</p>

<p>“You look nice in bed,” she said softly, “but
not a bit what I expected.”</p>

<p>“I am not what I was, of course,” he said
hastily.</p>

<p>“Are you a Once Was? Poor darling—does it
hurt? Do you like my frock?”</p>

<p>He said he liked it—enormously.</p>

<p>“And my shoes?”</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>“Mother says I get my slim feet from you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does she? Do go home, my child. How are
you going home?”</p>

<p>“Where are your slippers?” She dived down.</p>

<p>“You’ve kicked them under the bed,” he
moaned; “they <em>were</em> there.”</p>

<p>“I never touched them; here they are!” She
slipped her feet into them; huge, red morocco slippers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
they were. Pillar would have remembered
where they had been bought, the day on which
they had been bought, and what kind of a woman
she was who had passed at the moment of buying.
They must have been the only size left in the bazaar.
Diana sat on the edge of the bed again and put
out her feet, the slippers swinging like pendulums
from the tips of her toes. “Mummy must retract
her words—she spoke in her haste—Marcus,
my Once Was, I’ve been dancing—did you ever
dance?”</p>

<p>“Dear child, do go, who is taking you home?”</p>

<p>“Six people. Pillar is taking care of them downstairs—Well,
if you insist, I suppose I must.
I shall love to stay with you. You don’t mind my
coming like this—do you? Look at me! D’you
like me?”</p>

<p>She was exactly—in theory—what Marcus
would have liked another man’s niece to be, slight,
graceful, with just that amount of assurance he
found right in woman; but one does not always
want one’s theories to live with one.</p>

<p>When he awoke a few hours later, he was firmly
convinced he had dreamed and had dreamed pleasantly
enough, and he closed his eyes to dream again;
but the dream had vanished. Pillar remained. He
brought him his tea, pulled up the blinds, put his
things in order, stooped and picked up from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
floor something that sparkled and laid it down on
the dressing-table.</p>

<p>When he had gone Marcus jumped out of bed,
went to the dressing-table and saw lying upon it
a small stone of glittering paste. He had not
dreamed then. He was glad—in a way. Diana
would be a disturbing element in a quiet life—distracting,
perhaps, rather than disturbing.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Sibyl Carston,</span> having arranged things entirely
to her satisfaction, straightway made
preparations to join her husband in that far-off
dependency. The preparations were quickly made.
She went down to see Dick at school: walked with
him through cool cloisters, out into the sun; paced
close-shaven lawns; drank in the beauty of it all
and expressed a hope that it was sinking into the
soul of her son.</p>

<p>“Oh, rather,” said the son, a little surprised that
his soul should be discussed. He realized the occasion
was a special one, otherwise it was the sort of
thing you didn’t talk about. It was there all right,
his soul, he supposed. It stirred to the sound of
beautiful music; also when he read in history of
deeds of valour!—you bet it did—at the greatness
of England in general; at the left-hand bowling
of one master in particular. It was all there, but he
didn’t want to talk about it.</p>

<p>“I understand, darling,” said his mother, “but
don’t stifle it.”</p>

<p>He wouldn’t, rather not. “But, I say, what’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
this about Diana and this London business and
Aunt Elsie? Rough on her, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, darling, I don’t think so. I want Diana to
have some fun.”</p>

<p>“There’s lots at Aunt Elsie’s. There are the
dogs, they’re good fun, and the rabbits, and the
farm. There’s always something to do there. Aunt
Elsie is jolly good fun, isn’t she?”</p>

<p>“So is Uncle Marcus.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” This doubtfully.</p>

<p>“He’s my brother, darling.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. I suppose you are bound in a kind of
way to think him funny then—you like him in a
way.”</p>

<p>“Very much.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Elsie doesn’t.”</p>

<p>“She has never seen him.”</p>

<p>“She jolly well doesn’t want to either.”</p>

<p>“Dick, darling, you will take care of Diana,
won’t you?” said his mother, changing the subject:
it was so difficult to keep to any subject with the
good-bye looming in the near distance.</p>

<p>Any one who says good-bye to the child she loves
for a long time (and a year to a mother is an eternity)
drinks deep of the cup of self-sacrifice. Sibyl’s
one thought was that Dick should not know what
she was suffering. Of course he knew: but if it were
her business—as mother—to bridge the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
across the sea, to talk of the near days when they
should be together again, it was his—as son—to
pretend he believed her. He assured her it was no
distance: he didn’t mind: it happened to lots of
boys: it was all right.</p>

<p>“You will take care of Diana?” she repeated—readjusting
the distance.</p>

<p>“Yes, rather; you don’t want her to marry while
you’re away, I suppose?—because I don’t quite
see how I should manage that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want her to marry while I’m away, of
course, although I hope she may some day.”</p>

<p>“Taboret Major admires her so, I thought I
would just ask.”</p>

<p>“He would be young to marry, wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Well, so would she—anyway, he wouldn’t
like me to talk about his private affairs, so don’t
say anything about it. And, I say, if you do see
him, I think you’d better not speak to him at all;
he doesn’t like people speaking to him. He’s going
to be a great writer—he thinks.”</p>

<p>Sibyl promised she wouldn’t speak to Taboret
Major, but Mr. Wane she must see. Mr. Wane was
Dick’s house-master, and Dick allowed he was very
fairly decent. But Dick had started early in life
with prejudices against masters and it was difficult
to overcome them. When he had come back from
his first term at a private school, he had resented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
with the whole force of his small being the injustice
of being given a holiday task. Until he had got
home he hadn’t known the beastly thing had come
with him. The perfidy of the master had embittered
him. “How could he have wished me a happy
holiday when he knew all the time that he had
given me this beastly thing to do?” he had asked.</p>

<p>It was a difficult question to answer. Masters
must answer it for themselves—at that day when
they too must answer questions: not only ask them.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you must see old Wane,” Dick admitted.</p>

<p>“We will walk about a little first—and talk—there
is so much to say—isn’t there?” said his
mother.</p>

<p>Dick nodded: she tightened the pressure of her
arm on his, and it spoke volumes. He kicked at the
little pebbles in the path, anything seemed to help.
“How high do you suppose that tree is?” he asked.
“It’s awfully old.”</p>

<p>The sun was in his mother’s eyes, she couldn’t
see. Neither could he, but he knew; it was sixty
feet high, so it wasn’t quite a fair question, was it?</p>

<p>“Not quite fair, my Dick.”</p>

<p>So much wasn’t quite fair.</p>

<p>If you can’t talk you can always eat an ice, at
least you can if you are a boy. Sibyl suggested it.
“Good business,” said Dick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>The ice was a help—a still greater help, two
ices. They seemed to help the swallowing part of
the business and good-byes largely consist of that.
Then Sibyl went to see Mr. Wane and Dick waited
outside—hoping she wouldn’t do anything funny—or
try to make the old man laugh. If Sibyl had
been, as a mother, a little less pretty and charming,
it is possible Dick would have been—as a boy—a
little less forward for his age, and might have been
possessed of a character that was less surprising
in its strength to his house-master. It is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. Wane was a just man and honourable, but
perhaps, to convince himself that Dick’s mother
had dimples, he may have emphasized a little
more than he need have done certain things that
had been “curiously brought to his notice” about
Dick. A certain sterling honesty of purpose—unusual
in so young a boy—Yes, they were there!
Two of them, one on each side of her mouth. A very
pretty mouth—a mouth that told of a certain
fastidiousness of character that appealed to Mr.
Wane. He only needed to give one or two instances,
which bore out what he had said about Dick’s
character, and a depth he had suspected, in the
eyes of Dick’s mother, he found and fathomed.</p>

<p>“Show me a boy’s mother!” he was wont to say.</p>

<p>Dick had shown him a pretty mother, and had
waited patiently outside while she talked about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
him! At last she joined him. Old Wane came out
with her and he was laughing, but he seemed all
right, <em>otherwise</em>.</p>

<p>Dick and his mother walked back through the
cool cloisters, out into the sun and over close-shaven
lawns. “Point out to your mother,” Mr.
Wane had said, “architectural features of interest,
my boy!” And Dick proceeded to do it. “That
gate, see? It was built—I don’t know when—in
the year, I don’t know what—by—I don’t know
who,”—and his mother was duly impressed. To
pay for this knowledge and other things there
must be spent years in hot climates. Money must
be saved so that when Dick was grown to be a man
he should look back to this time as the happiest in
his life. If all this and the sense of its past should
sink into his soul, it must help to make him one of
England’s proudest sons.</p>

<p>At the railway station they parted, and Sibyl
watched till she could no longer see her small pink-faced
son, who was growing, for all his smallness—so
big, so tall, so reserved.</p>

<p>After Dick’s mother had left him, an uncomfortable
way all visiting mothers have, Dick, unconscious
of that curious nobility of character that
Mr. Wane, somewhat to his own surprise, had endowed
him with, felt very lonely. He hated islands,
beastly far-off islands, rotten places for mothers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
go to—what was the matter with England? He
asked Taboret Major, and Taboret Major said,
“Nothing, absolutely nothing—England was all
right.” And he and Dick walked down to the cricket
fields (their England) and it was all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wane, who had lately been brought to bed
of her third son, was propped up on her pillows
and Mr. Wane was sitting beside her. That he had
something on his mind she knew. Mothers always
upset him: they upset boys too; being altogether
upsetting things.</p>

<p>“He <em>is</em> a very nice boy—a <em>very</em> nice boy—a
<em>particularly</em> nice boy, I should say,” he said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>He had said it three times, so Mrs. Wane put
out her hand and closing it on his said—“Was
she so very charming and attractive?” And Mr.
Wane laughed, for in spite of what Dick knew to
the contrary, “old Wane” could see a joke, and
that joke against himself.</p>

<p>“You dear!” he said to his wife, and she answered:
“He <em>is</em> a nice boy—a <em>very</em> nice boy—a
<em>particularly</em> nice boy—and there’s another just as
nice—and you might tell his mother so without
its causing you any after pricks of conscience, or
remorse.” And she looked towards the cradle in
which slept profoundly Wane Minimus.</p>

<p>“He’s very good and quiet,” admitted his father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“He knows perhaps,” said his mother, “that his
father is one from whom it is supposed the secrets
of no small boy can be hid. By instinct he knows
that: later on I shall tell him that he need not be
quite so good, or so quiet; that although as a
schoolmaster it is your bounden duty to know the
secrets of all small schoolboys, as a father you are
just as blind—and just as weak as any other well-dispositioned
father. It is in order to make schoolmasters
human that mothers marry them—there
could be no other reason. Now tell me all about
Carston’s mother and just what it was you said to
her about him?”</p>

<p>That night, as Mr. Wane undressed, he was still
a little uneasy.</p>

<p>“He is a <em>particularly</em> nice boy,” he murmured;
but this it was that rankled—Barker’s mother
had been down, too, and Barker was a particularly
nice boy—he had faults, of course, so had Dick—but
he had told Barker’s mother of Barker’s faults.
He had not spared her: nor had he cared whether
she had dimples or not—perhaps because she
had not.</p>

<p>Before he got into bed he thanked God for the
inestimable gift of a good wife—and he meant it;
and of an understanding wife—he meant that
too; and of a beautiful wife—he meant that too—in
the highest sense.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Diana took up her abode in the house
of her uncle, she arrived late, dressed, and
went out again to dinner. That was not how Marcus
would have had her arrive. She must understand
that order was the keynote of his establishment.
How otherwise could he expect to keep so
excellent a housekeeper as Mrs. Oven? Pillar, too,
must be considered. She must state definitely when
she would be in to dinner and when not.</p>

<p>“I was not,” she said later, when taxed, “definitely
not.”</p>

<p>Marcus dined alone. As he came downstairs
dressed for dinner, he met a housemaid going up,
with a glass of milk on a tray. On the tray there
was also a plate, on the plate there was a banana,
and beside the banana lay glistening a halfpenny
bun. The meal of some one’s particular choosing,
he should say. In no other way could it have found
its way upstairs in his house. But whose meal was
it?</p>

<p>That he had two housemaids he knew. He saw
evidence of their being in the brightness of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
brasses, the polish of the furniture, but he hardly
knew them apart. The bun-bearer was one of them.
He went on his way deploring that in his house
there was no back staircase. But for whom could
a vagrant banana be?</p>

<p>Tentatively he put the question to Pillar, as
ashamed to ask it as Pillar was to answer it. Pillar
murmured something about a mischance, and Mr.
Maitland was quick to admit it. It was certainly
an accident meeting the banana on the stairs; but
the meal itself remained unexplained, and inexcused;
it must have been predestined. Then it
struck him that Diana must have brought a maid.
It was quite right she should. He might have
guessed it. But a maid who lived on buns and
bananas, could she be efficient?</p>

<p>Marcus dined uncomfortably. The dinner seemed
less good than usual. Gradually it was borne in
upon him that it must be Mrs. Oven who was in
bed and who was feeding on buns and bananas.
She had lost her taste, her sense, her gastronomic
taste—her sense of taste. Everything!</p>

<p>Towards twelve o’clock Diana came in, unrepentant
and delightful; she floated in, as it were, on
a cloud of tulle, a veritable will-o’-the-wisp, a thing
as light as gossamer, as elusive as a firefly. She had
a great deal to tell Marcus and told him none of
it. She was lost in the depth of his huge sofa—she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
looked like drifted snow—blown there by the wind.
He didn’t tell her that, even if he thought it. What
he did tell her was that he expected his guests to
go to bed early. This in obedience to an instinct
that told him to begin as he meant to go on—</p>

<p>Diana said she could not go to bed early—that
night, at all events. She would go as early as she
could—as early in the morning. “I have a confession
to make. Shall I make it now or wait till
to-morrow? In ten minutes it will be to-morrow.
To-morrow never used to come so soon.”</p>

<p>“Why not now?”</p>

<p>“No, I could not sleep unforgiven.”</p>

<p>“But why should you? What if I forgave you?”</p>

<p>Horrible thoughts flashed through Marcus’s
mind. What could she have to confess? Happier
thoughts—what could there be that he would not
forgive? forgive her? There were things he could
not forgive a man. All the things he had heard of
modern girls and their ways passed through his
mind, all the things he had ever heard of men from
the days of man’s innocency until now. Then he
looked at Diana. The modern girl was all right; she
was delicious. But men—men? Would they find
Diana distracting? Or was it because he was no
longer young that her youth seemed so appealing,
her freshness, her gaiety so infectious? He had
always felt he could never have made a successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
or even a comfortably happy father. A creature
like this he could never have let out of his sight: all
men would have become his enemies by very reason
of their existence.</p>

<p>“Once Was,” said Diana softly, “why so
dreamy? You make me sleepy. Good-morning!”</p>

<p>She went to bed, unconfessed, unforgiven. Pillar
put out the lights downstairs. Marcus put them
out on his landing. Above that it was Diana’s business.
“Don’t forget the lights, Diana,” he called.</p>

<p>At one o’clock in the morning Diana was singing
in her bath and Marcus lay in bed wondering what
it was she wanted to confess. He fell asleep uncertain
whether he liked a niece in the house or not.
He had pictured to himself a quiet, mousey niece,
demure and obedient! But how charming she had
looked on the sofa!—she got her feet from him,
did she? A great attraction in women, pretty feet;
and none too common. He must see that she gave
enough for her boots. It was where some women
economized. He shuddered to think of women out
in the street, on muddy days, in house shoes.
Horrible!</p>

<p>Diana came down to breakfast. That was to her
credit. To bed late: yet up early. She looked delicious:
not in the least tired and very fresh and
clean. A girl may be both without looking triumphantly
so, as Diana did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>After breakfast with Marcus was a sacred hour,
dedicated to his newspapers and his pipe, yet
after breakfast Diana planted herself on the edge
of his chair and proceeded to get to know him.
Not until she had done that, she said, could she
make her confession.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, ready to forgive anything,
if only that he might be left in peace.</p>

<p>“I brought Shan’t with me; do you mind?”</p>

<p>“A maid?” he said. “A dyspeptic maid,” he
added to himself.</p>

<p>“Well, she’s female—certainly—I’ll say that
for her.”</p>

<p>Marcus would have allowed that himself—in
spite of her addiction to zoölogical fare.</p>

<p>“She’s such a willing little beast. She won’t eat
if I go away—so I had to bring her—see, my
Once Was?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a dog? My dear Diana, of course, I can’t
have it upstairs, but Pillar will be delighted to
exercise the little beast—”</p>

<p>No dog explained the banana and the milk, but
he said nothing.</p>

<p>“Dear child!”—he was feeling very fond of
Diana—“I should like to see—whatever you
call it—is it trained and—”</p>

<p>“Shan’t! Shan’t!” called Diana up the stairs.
“Come! Hurry up!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“It was a funny way to talk to a dog,” thought
Marcus. If at that moment he had looked up from
his paper he would certainly have thought it a funny
dog that walked into the dining-room. “Well?”</p>

<p>Marcus turned in answer to the interrogation
and beheld a small girl of four or five, standing,
beaming at him, the very quintessence of willingness
and loving-kindness. “We-ell?” she repeated.</p>

<p>There are those in life who carry the mackintoshes
of others; who leave the last fresh egg for
others; the early peas for others; the first asparagus
for others; who look up trains for others; find
servants for others; houses for others; who cry with
others; who laugh with others. They are as a rule
spinsters who do these things and they do them
gladly—even the crying. Yes! Shan’t-if-I-don’t-want-to,
Shan’t for short, was a spinster, and
Marcus recognized her as one of those born to
do things for others. She could laugh and cry at
the same time, run faster than any child of her age
to do your bidding. She could soothe your pain
with her smile: and touch your heart with her
laugh. These things Marcus did not as yet know.
But he was glad directly he saw her that she was
not a dog, and he grudged her neither the milk,
nor the bun, nor the banana, nor the distracting
of Mrs. Oven from the cooking of his dinner, which
said much for the fascination of Shan’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>There she stood longing to do things, aching,
benevolence beaming from her eyes. “Well?” she
repeated.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” said Marcus, and he got up
and stood looking down with amazement on this
small person, who stood so willingly waiting. Suddenly
she looked at his feet and like a flash she was
gone.</p>

<p>“Who in the world is it, Diana?” he asked
sternly, but his heart had become as water, and his
bones like wax. Here was the child of his dreams,
the child he had played Hide-and-Seek with, told
his longest stories to, taken to the Zoo, saved from
drowning.</p>

<p>“That’s Shan’t-if-I-don’t-want-to! That’s one
of her names, but she always does want to. She’s
the jolliest little beggar in the world. Mummy says
I can’t have her for my own, but she is my own
and I am hers. Here she is. She is bound to have
fetched something for you. For Heaven’s sake, say
‘Thank you.’”</p>

<p>She had fetched his slippers. Now Marcus Maitland
would rather go without breakfast than
breakfast in slippers, but he said, “Tha-ank you.”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Diana, “if by chance I ruffled your
hair she’d be off for your hair-brushes before you
knew where you were.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where I am, as it is,” said Marcus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
edging away from the devastating hands of Diana.
He loathed his hair ruffled.</p>

<p>“Put on your slippers,” said Shan’t, pointing to
his feet.</p>

<p>“But I have only just put on my boots.”</p>

<p>“Put—them—on and don’t—argue,” said
Shan’t.</p>

<p>“But—”</p>

<p>“Pe—lease!” Shan’t looked at him, and Marcus,
feeling about as determined as a worm can
feel under the steady pressure of a garden-roller,
stooped down and began to unlace his boots. To
do it properly he must have a button-hook. Could
Shan’t know to what an exquisite discomfort she
was putting him?</p>

<p>“No,” said Diana, “you needn’t. No, Shan’t,
you can fetch something else.”</p>

<p>“No, sit down, Shan’t,” commanded her uncle.
“I want to look at you.”</p>

<p>She sat down on a footstool, folded her hands
and looked up at her uncle. “Funny old fing!”
she said, wrinkling her nose; “you didn’t know
I was coming, did you?”</p>

<p>Marcus said he had had no idea.</p>

<p>“Diana said you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Say your poem, Shan’t,” said Diana. “It’s her
own—her very own,” she added. “Go on, Shan’t.”</p>

<p>“I forget it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“How can you forget it when it’s your own?”</p>

<p>“Well, I have.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t—One-two-three.”</p>

<p>Marcus knew it to be the fashion among poets
to read their own works. He wondered if they
needed treatment as drastic as this, or if they did
it more willingly? In the muse of charity perhaps
they did.</p>

<p>“One—two—three,” said Diana sternly, and
Shan’t began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Swing me higher,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Oh, Delia, oh, Delia!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Swing me over the garden wall—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Only do not let me fall.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Found in the garden</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Dead in her beauty.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Was she not a dainty dish</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To set before the king?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>All this very, very fast, and at the end of it
Shan’t, pink and breathless, as any poet should
be after being called upon to recite his own poem
half an hour after breakfast.</p>

<p>“Does your aunt know you’re here?” asked
Marcus.</p>

<p>“She does—<em>now</em>,” said Shan’t seriously.</p>

<p>“How did you get away without being seen?”
Marcus thought that no well-brought-up child
could ever escape from its Nannies and nursery-maids.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
The safety of England depended on the
safeguarding of her children. He had heard that
said, and he knew there were societies to enforce
it because he had subscribed to them.</p>

<p>Up sprang Shan’t, the better to tell her story. A
dramatic sense was hers. “I ran down the back
stairs—and I ran down the drive—and I ran
down the garden—and I ran froo the gates—and
I ran down the road and I ran over the be-ridge.
And then I didn’t run any—more. I just
waited for Diana—and we came.”</p>

<p>A deep sigh followed this statement. The air
escaping from an air cushion was the only thing
Marcus could think of that compared with the
exhaustiveness of the sigh. At that moment Pillar
brought a telegram and Mr. Maitland opened it.
Pillar glanced quickly at the child and Shan’t’s
smile proclaimed him her friend. He was on her
side.</p>

<p>“Diana, it is from your aunt,” said Marcus;
“she says, ‘Return Shan’t at once’!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Shan’t; “shan’t if I don’t want to.”
And she was off and out of the room, out of the
front door, opened by the telegraph boy, who boylike
was always as ready to let anything out as he
was to catch and cage anything, through the door
into the street: across the road and into the square
through the garden gate that stood ajar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“Let her run!” called Diana to her vanishing
uncle; “she’ll soon tire.” But Marcus had gone in
eager pursuit. He crossed the street, was through
the gate and on to Shan’t before she had gone
many yards down the straight path that ran
through the square. He caught her in his arms.
“By Jove, how she wriggles!” There was imminent
danger of the uncle being left with the clothes of
Shan’t in his arms, and no Shan’t. Appreciating
the danger he relaxed his hold. Off she went, but
to be caught again, and easily enough. She was hot.
He could feel her heart beating in her small body,
as a bird might flutter against the bars of the cage
that imprisons it. She was such a little thing.
“Shan’t,” he said, “come here.” He drew her towards
him; he sat down and lifted her on to his
knee.</p>

<p>“Shan’t if I don’t want to!” she whispered.</p>

<p>“But you’re going to want to.”</p>

<p>“Always do—mostly always do,” she said, crying
softly; not really crying, she assured him,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Look here,” said her uncle, “d’you know what
you are?”</p>

<p>“Lucky little devil,” she hazarded.</p>

<p>“Well—but seriously—a good little girl—and
such a willing little beggar, isn’t that it?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “Always—mostly always.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Look here—willing little beggars always do
what they are asked and Aunt”—Marcus paused—“Aunt—what
do you call her?”</p>

<p>“Elsie—only-aunt-in-the-world.”</p>

<p>“There are others, of course,” said Marcus
stiffly; “Aunt Elsie—”</p>

<p>“Only-aunt-in-the-world,” said Shan’t; “say it!”
She laid a finger on his lips.</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Elsie-only-aunt-in-the-world wants
you to go back to her because she’s lonely.”</p>

<p>“She’s got free dogs!”</p>

<p>“Free?”</p>

<p>“One—two—free—” “Free” found the tip
of Shan’t’s forefinger lightly laid on the tip of
Marcus’s nose.</p>

<p>“Yes; but she wants you—and if you are a
good little girl and go back you shall come again
and stay—”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“We might say Christmas-time.”</p>

<p>“When else?”</p>

<p>“—Easter, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“We have eggs at Easter,”—this softly reminiscent.</p>

<p>“You shall have eggs here.”</p>

<p>“What inside of them?”</p>

<p>“Oh—little presents.”</p>

<p>“What little presents? Whistles?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“And knives?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised.”</p>

<p>“Why wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Because I should know.”</p>

<p>“What would you know?”</p>

<p>“Well, about the knives.”</p>

<p>“Would you guess?”</p>

<p>“I expect so.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of something—No, <em>you</em> do!”</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> think of something?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is it animal, vegetable, or amiable?”</p>

<p>“It’s animal.”</p>

<p>“Is it in this room?”</p>

<p>Marcus gently pointed out that they were not
in a room, and Shan’t pointed out less gently that
he wasn’t playing properly. Marcus had had very
serious thoughts as to whether he should allow
Shan’t’s version of animal, vegetable, or mineral
to pass unquestioned, or whether he should tell
her she wasn’t playing the game?</p>

<p>“Is it the poker?” asked Shan’t.</p>

<p>“A poker isn’t animal.”</p>

<p>“Then you should have said it was amiable—that’s
what pokers are. I did guess quickly, didn’t
I?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>At this moment Diana joined them, and the inhabitants
of the square garden saw the unusual
sight of that rather unfriendly Mr. Maitland sitting
on a garden seat, with a child on his knee, while a
girl, a very attractive girl, stood by, egging him
on as it were.</p>

<p>“She’s going back to Aunt Elsie, Diana,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Only-aunt-in-the-world—Say it,” said Shan’t.</p>

<p>He said it, repeating, “She’s going back.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t if I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“But you will, Shan’t,” said Diana, “because—look
at me!”</p>

<p>Shan’t threw back her head and looked at Diana.</p>

<p>“Because <em>I—want</em> you to,” said Diana.</p>

<p>Shan’t slipped off her uncle’s knee, ran across
the grass, over the road, in at the hall door, at
which Pillar was standing, into the dining-room,
and laid her head on a chair and sobbed.</p>

<p>“Poor little beggar,” said Diana.</p>

<p>“Diana, shall I?” He was longing to comfort her.</p>

<p>“No, you’ll spoil it all. You can’t give in now—if
you say a child must do a thing, make her do it.
You have lost your chance.”</p>

<p>As one convicted of a crime Marcus returned to
the dining-room. When Pillar came into the room
he looked at Mr. Maitland as he had never looked
at him before—looked as if he were saying: “A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
little sunshine comes into the house and you shut
it out—you draw down the blinds!”</p>

<p>It fell to the lot of Mrs. Oven to take Miss Shan’t
back to her aunt. She called her Miss Charlotte,
thinking Shan’t was but the correct way of pronouncing
Charlotte. She had lived with a Lady
Harriet who had been very particular to pronounce
her name curiously, and Mrs. Oven recognized a
distinction attached to curiously pronounced names
and respected those who knew how to pronounce
them.</p>

<p>“You see, Diana,” explained her uncle, “I am
delighted to have you, but two extra in the house
do make a difference, especially when the second
one is a child. There are the servants to consider,
and besides there is your aunt—”</p>

<p>Diana said Aunt Elsie would never let him have
Shan’t, so he needn’t worry.</p>

<p>“My dear Diana, your aunt has not the power
to prevent me from having Shan’t if I wish to—”</p>

<p>“You <em>will</em> wish to. The day will come when you
will find you can’t live without her. I can’t imagine
what I shall do without her, but I quite see you
can’t have two of us—it’s too darling of you to
have me, and Aunt Elsie must be considered.”</p>

<p>“With your Aunt Elsie I have nothing whatever
to do. I owe her no consideration. I don’t know
her—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“All right, darling, don’t be flurried. She doesn’t
want to know you. She dislikes you quite amazingly.”</p>

<p>“Why should she?” asked Marcus, finding the
unreasonableness of women difficult to understand.</p>

<p>That evening Mr. Maitland offered Pillar Zoo
tickets for Sunday.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, sir; I would not deprive another
more fitted—”</p>

<p>“There’s a new baby giraffe.” This was an attraction
never before known to fail in its lure.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, sir, at the Zoölogical Gardens one’s
mind harks back, as it were, to children. It’s better
not to think of children when you’re in a house
where there are none, and none to come—so to
speak.”</p>

<p>The next day Marcus got a letter from the only
aunt in the world and the letter ran as follows:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Maitland</span>,—I think it should be
clearly understood before we go any further that I
have as much right to my brother’s children as you
have to the children of your sister. I do not wish to
stand in Diana’s way and I am delighted she should
have such a chance as you are giving her, but Shan’t
is mine. Her mother did not leave her in your
charge. She left her in mine. She is a most charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
companion, but would be utterly lost upon a
bachelor—as you appear to be—living in London.</p>

<p>If, however, at any time you should agree to
lend me Diana for a week, I will lend you Shan’t.
But it must be quite clearly understood that you
do not have both together, at any time. If the two
sisters should wish to be together, and it is only
natural they should, I think their mother would
say the place for them to be together is here. You
are not likely to appreciate the extraordinary character
of Shan’t, and it is quite possible the child
would wear herself out as your slave. With Diana
there is no such danger. You will find her delightful,
but the slaving must be on your side. Shan’t has just
returned safely, so far as I can see none the worse
for her adventure. I must thank you for sending
her back in the care of so respectable and excellent
a woman. Shan’t has a name, by the way: it is
Elsie; you must have known it.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="padding-right: 3em">Yours truly,</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Elsie Carston</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>“A most disagreeable letter,” said Marcus as he
folded it and put it into his pocket, to re-read later.
“A most uncalled-for letter. I sent the child back
at once. Most men would have kept her.”</p>

<p>He began then and there to wonder why he had
not kept her. Talk of dogs! (Miss Carston was devoted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
to dogs, it seemed.) What dog had ever attracted
him as Shan’t had done? What dog had
ever looked so willing? Not even a retriever was so
humbly anxious to do anything in the world to
please. She was such a jolly little thing to hold—so
small—so easily crushed—funny, jolly little
thing! Why should Miss Carston have her? Under
the care of Miss Carston she would grow up a
suffragette; would grow up everything a man
would wish a girl not to be; self-opinionated,
strong-minded, argumentative; always right, never
wrong. It was a horrible thought. And Pillar had
been perfectly willing that Shan’t should stay. If
Pillar didn’t mind, who should?</p>

<p>It was only right that Diana and Shan’t should
not be separated. Miss Carston could have Dick in
the holidays. That should satisfy her. If anything
could satisfy a nature so exacting!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">So</span> far Elsie had won—so she thought. She had
got Shan’t back, but Shan’t, with the glamour
of London upon her, was restless, longing to talk,
aching to tell all she had seen and heard in London—“darlin’
old London.” But Aunt Elsie was obdurate.
She did not want to hear anything about
Uncle Marcus, and London was Uncle Marcus just
as Uncle Marcus was London. She wanted to know
what Shan’t had remembered of her Bible lesson?
What she had remembered about Zacharias? She
had learnt all about him just before she had gone
to London!</p>

<p>“<em>Did</em> I?” asked Shan’t, doubting, but open to
conviction.</p>

<p>Before Aunt Elsie, as a prisoner before the judge,
she stood. She made one or two manœuvres, the
first to make Aunt Elsie smile; the next to distract
her attention. But Aunt Elsie neither smiled nor
allowed her attention to be distracted. “Tell me
what you remember about Zacharias,” she said.</p>

<p>Shan’t sighed. It was no good. “Zacha-ri-as?”
she pondered. She stood first on one leg, then on
the other. What <em>did</em> she remember? Raising pellucid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
eyes to Aunt Elsie, and higher still to Heaven,
she began, “Zacharias was—a just man and he
stood before the altar of the Lord—and—an
angel came to him and said, ‘Zacharias, you are
goin’ to have a baby,’ and Zacharias said, ‘I am
not,’ and the angel said, ‘I beg your pardon, you
are, and what’s more you’ll be dumb till you get
it—’ That’s all,” said Shan’t.</p>

<p>“You know that wasn’t what you learnt,
Shan’t.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it?” she said surprised; then added,
“It’s a pity, isn’t it?” She looked at her Aunt
Elsie, and Aunt Elsie saw with relief Mrs. Sloane
coming towards her. She had never loved her
neighbour better, and she had always loved her
well.</p>

<p>As she walked along Mrs. Sloane bowed to those
flowers she knew by sight, recognized and spoke to
those she personally knew, and exclaimed she had
never met another. A garden-lover was she in another
woman’s garden. A generous visitor! There
was nothing that grew in her garden better than
in Elsie’s. She never said: “Ah, yes, of course, the
same thing exactly, but mine are deeper—richer
in colour; a matter of soil, of course. That only
three inches high! Why, mine grew that in one
night—a much better night, of course. It’s only
a question of—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane never said the wrong thing in the
gardens of others. She was dearly loved in consequence,
and every gardener felt in her presence a
better gardener than he really was—just as every
man felt a better man. And that, after all, is a good
woman’s work in life, to make men feel better than
they are—for by the time they grow accustomed
to the feeling and get over the shyness it entails,
they find it has become a habit and they are
better.</p>

<p>It could be truthfully said of Mrs. Sloane, as
was said of somebody by somebody—that whatever
her age she didn’t look it. The tribute savours
of the wit and understanding of Sidney Smith,
whose judgment on the matter of babies is almost
as well known as Solomon’s. Mrs. Sloane was triumphantly
young, although to Shan’t she was a
very, very old lady; but Shan’t was too young to
recognize youth when she met it in the guise of old
age.</p>

<p>Across the lawn, to the rescue of Aunt Elsie,
came Mrs. Sloane. She wore a mushroom hat and
gardening gloves and used a spud as walking-stick.
“How goes the war?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You may go, Shan’t,” said Aunt Elsie.</p>

<p>“You got her back, then? With or without
difficulty?”</p>

<p>“You may go, Shan’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>“I came back with Mrs. Oven,” said Shan’t,
swinging her leg, reluctant to go.</p>

<p>“Shan’t, you may go.”</p>

<p>At that moment Shan’t would rather have
turned head over heels. She would have found it
easier.</p>

<p>“Run along, darling.”</p>

<p>“Must I?”</p>

<p>“Must she?” asked Mrs. Sloane.</p>

<p>Shan’t edged nearer, leant up against Mrs.
Sloane, who slipped an arm round her. “Did you
have a nice time?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Diana’s got b-blue silk curtains on her bed.”</p>

<p>“Has she? Is she very happy?”</p>

<p>Shan’t nodded. “I watched her dress. Then I
went downstairs—and Uncle Marcus didn’t know
I was comin’—he <em>was</em> surprised—”</p>

<p>“Run along, Shan’t; you must do what I tell you,
whatever you did with your uncle—”</p>

<p>Shan’t walked away backwards, stopped to seize
Marcus, clutched at every excuse to linger—every
daisy became a valid excuse—</p>

<p>“This is what comes of going to London,” said
Aunt Elsie; “I knew what it would be.”</p>

<p>Shan’t walked away trailing her feet as she went,
stubbing the toes of her shoes into the ground—disgusted
with life. No one ran after her—made
much of her and begged her to be good when she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
was good all the time. She had liked Pillar! He had
“amoozed” her. She had liked Mrs. Oven! London!
everything! Moreover, Diana was there—Diana,
whom she adored; life without her was dull. Shan’t
wished it was tea-time.</p>

<p>“Now tell me,” said Mrs. Sloane to Elsie.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to tell. Shan’t went with
Diana. It was very wrong of Diana. The child, of
course, wasn’t to blame. I wired for her and he
sent her back at once, in the care of a most excellent
woman. She looked a good cook—you can
tell, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“At a glance, just as easily as you can tell a
good coachman—or, for the matter of that, a
good clergyman—”</p>

<p>“Talking of clergymen—” And Elsie unburdened
her heart about Shan’t and Zacharias.</p>

<p>“Dear Zacharias!” said Mrs. Sloane; “I wonder
if he had a sense of humour.” This was beside the
point, so Elsie brought her back to the odious
uncle, who obviously had none. What should she
do? It was evident he had designs upon the children,
he might even kidnap them. She didn’t
trust him a yard. Mrs. Sloane suggested counter-attractions.
Sparks lit in the eyes of the harassed
aunt. What distraction could the country offer
that could compare with the attraction of London?</p>

<p>“There is no reason a dance should not be given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
when you want Diana back—a dance in the country
is very delightful, so long as it be sufficiently
well done, and the right people come, and the right
band plays, and the bright moon shines.”</p>

<p>“Who would give one?—you wouldn’t?” This
was a bow at a venture.</p>

<p>“And why not in so good a cause?”</p>

<p>“You are an angel.”</p>

<p>“It is not the first time I have been told so when
I have but done my most obvious duty against my
neighbour’s enemy.”</p>

<p>“There is no one like you.”</p>

<p>“There is much to be thankful for. By the way,
does Mr. Watkins come and doze these days in
your garden?”</p>

<p>Mr. Watkins, the literary recluse, of whom Lady
Carston was afraid, had taken to sitting in Miss
Carston’s garden. He found he could write better,
read better, and dream better there than anywhere.
The peace of it all he found wonderfully soothing.
The clatter of the milk-pails at the farm distracted
him: the lowing of the cows depressed him (it made
him feel the bitterness of his loneliness): the squealings
of the pigs were too suggestive: the cackling
of hens reminded him of women he had known and
would fain forget.</p>

<p>“He must enjoy these lovely days,” said Mrs.
Sloane slyly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>Elsie said he had not been for some time. She
supposed he was busy.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Pease, the curate? His rooms were so
stuffy, he said; didn’t he? Does he come? I suppose
so?”</p>

<p>No, Elsie was bound to admit that the curate
had not been for some time. She supposed he, too,
was busy.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Sloane went on her way smiling.
“Diana! Diana!” she said to herself, “oh, to be
young again! How you must enjoy it all!” She
stopped. “Well, well, my dear! I never expected
to see you rioting like this. Why are you so shy in
some gardens? What’s this about not growing unless
you are put in a draughty place?” And she lifted
a trail of Tropæolum and put it on its right way.</p>

<p>Just outside Elsie’s gate Mrs. Sloane met Mr.
Watkins. “You are coming in?”—and she held
the gate open.</p>

<p>“Not to-day, I think,” said the weary Mr. Watkins,
adding something about his soul’s solitude,—“not
to-day!”</p>

<p>“You should not keep all your beautiful thoughts
to yourself,” said Mrs. Sloane. It was perhaps an
unfortunate remark, because Mr. Watkins hastened
to inform her that for two and sixpence,
postage paid, she could read his latest and best—whatever
the critics might choose to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” said Mrs. Sloane, “but I
am sure you have thoughts that are too beautiful
to be put into words, on paper! They may pass
from true friend to true friend—in the quiet of a
friend’s garden. Among the flowers words may be
spoken that printer’s ink would blur.”</p>

<p>Now Mr. Watkins felt that this dear old lady
was trying to encroach upon his garden of thought,
to wander down the paths of beautiful thoughts
which were for his feet alone to travel. If any one
in Bestways said beautiful things he surely was the
one to do it, so he thought a moment, waved his
hand, and smiling sadly murmured: “They come
and go—lighter than air, finer than gossamer,
ephemeral—butterflies—butterflies of thought,
transparent—nebulous—”</p>

<p>“Moonshine!” said Mrs. Sloane, delighted to
have found a word. If she had had less than ten
thousand a year Watkins would have been very
deeply pained. But as she was said to have rather
more than that he was amused.</p>

<p>“You may want to sit in the garden—Miss
Carston’s garden—again some day. Don’t let
the briars grow over the path, or you may not find
it again.”</p>

<p>“What does she mean?” thought Mr. Watkins,
as he went on his way thinking sadly of Diana, who
alone in Bestways had had the power to inspire him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>A little further on Mrs. Sloane met the curate.
“Going to Miss Carston’s garden?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No, I wasn’t.” He stopped. “Do you think I
ought? Would it be politic?” he asked.</p>

<p>And Mrs. Sloane told him he would be a bishop
one day.</p>

<p>“That’s what you meant?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You are brighter than Mr. Watkins.”</p>

<p>“I might be that without setting the Thames on
fire, mightn’t I?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane went on her way, and Mr. Pease on
his, both thinking of Diana. What a ripping old
lady Mrs. Sloane was! Of course, if he didn’t go
and sit in Miss Carston’s garden when Miss Diana
was away—it would look as if he only went there
to see Miss Diana!—and he felt the ghost-like
grip of gaiters on his legs.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Of</span> course Sibyl’s friends were surprised that
she should have left her children, and of
course they said so; what are friends for if they do
not say what they think?</p>

<p>Said one: “I should be afraid to love a man so
much; he might die.” Said another: “Is that reason
enough for not loving a man?” Another, a great
friend, found it an extraordinary thing leaving her
girl, just out.</p>

<p>“You know what the girl says of her mother?”
asked another. “She says she is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande amoureuse</i>!”</p>

<p>“Most extraordinary leaving her,” said yet another,
having nothing more original to say.</p>

<p>It was passed along the dado of dowagers at a
ball and most of them agreed. Only one said a
husband came first, but she was a moderately
young dowager with a tilted tiara and memories
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“When he’s young,” suggested another.</p>

<p>“Yes, but Eustace is old enough to look after
himself,” several agreed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marcus looked after Diana. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
found him curiously and delightfully old-fashioned—much
more so than Aunt Elsie.</p>

<p>She loved to tease him about his collections.
“That darling little Ming thing,” she said, with
her head on one side, an invitation to correction.</p>

<p>He wished she would speak more reverently of
the Chinese—“The Ming thing, as you call
it—”</p>

<p>“<em>Darling</em> Ming thing,” interposed Diana, with
her head on the other side.</p>

<p>“—As you call it,” went on Marcus, disapproving
her attitude of irreverence, “is a thing before
which experts bow.”</p>

<p>“Worshipping it as its maker worshipped his
ancestors.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could educate you, Diana, to speak
wisely, at all events.”</p>

<p>“Is ‘darling little Ming thing’ not wise?” she
asked. “Well, now,—let us consider it. If it’s
not darling, what is it? You won’t let me call it
dear, and it’s not impatient—obstructive—indifferent—argumentative—callous—but
it is
darling, just darling. Soft to the touch—pleasing
to the eye—a very ready-money way of spending.
Do you know what you could do with what you
paid for that darling little Ming thing?”</p>

<p>Marcus shook his head.</p>

<p>“You could take a baby from its earliest days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
from its cradle—you could feed it, clothe it. You
could teach it to write, to talk (when spoken to), to
spell—talk wisely, write wisely, and spell correctly.
You could send it to school—privately, publicly.
You could college it—if it scholarshipped itself.
You could train it in the business way it should go.
It might become a politician, a financier, a collector
of Chinese porcelain—or a useful member of
society and a good citizen; and for all that there
stands the darling little Ming thing in a cabinet—untouched
by housemaids.”</p>

<p>“You ridiculous child,” said Marcus, and his
thoughts flew to that girl who had taken in her
dogskin-gloved hands a vase less beautiful, infinitely
less valuable, than any in his collection,
yet most desirable.</p>

<p>“Aunt Elsie’s got a delicious powder-blue vase,”
said Diana.</p>

<p>“Has she?” said Marcus, knowing the kind of
blue china women with country cottages invest in.</p>

<p>Marcus was not so wise as he thought. Diana
discovered that before she had been in his house
a week. While she was discovering him not so very
wise, he was finding her delightfully sympathetic.
Discounting her understanding—certain of her
sympathy—he unburdened his soul to her because,
he said, she must have suffered just as he
had. Her mother’s absorption in her father must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
have grieved her: she must have felt out of it: she
and Dick too—</p>

<p>“You think that? How strange!” said Diana, her
chin in her hands, her eyes looking at him with their
habitual expression of understanding. “Why, Dick
and I have often discussed it and we think quite
differently. We are so glad she should have that
tremendous happiness. We love to see her. An
ordinary humdrum affection would never have
satisfied her. I believe their love for each other is
the kind of which you read in history—more particularly
in French memoirs—it’s almost terrifying.
She’s his inspiration and without her he isn’t
himself. The sympathy between them is amazing.
Once when I was ill—he was away—she tried to
keep it from him; she said nothing in her letters
and he telegraphed: ‘What is it? Tell me.’ It’s no
use standing against that, my Uncle Marcus, and
we don’t want to. No one could be more to me than
Mummy is, but Dick and I are very near to one
another,—nearer than most brothers and sisters,—and
somehow or other we feel as if we ought to
be more understanding than most children whose
parents don’t understand each other at all—See?”</p>

<p>“Yes—and if you marry—as your mother
married?” said Marcus, still seeking an excuse for
the hurt that was within him—even now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Diana said: “If I did, Dick would be very
pleased. Love can’t be selfish and live—even
Shan’t says, ‘Love can’t be shelfish,’ and it can’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t love,” said Marcus ruefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, my uncle, you do.”</p>

<p>“It’s a devilish selfish kind of love, then.”</p>

<p>“It is that,” agreed Diana softly.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” confessed Marcus, “bear to think of
your aunt waiting to snatch you from me. She’s
so violent.”</p>

<p>Diana laughed. “What a delightful description
of Aunt Elsie!”</p>

<p>“Tell me—what is she like?”</p>

<p>“She’s devilish unselfish—very charming—and
she wears an elastic to keep her hat on—”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” said Marcus; he had had enough.</p>

<p>There entered into Marcus’s soul a great peace
(when he could forget the aunt); into his house
floods of sunshine. The blinds were pulled up, right
up to the top, let go with a bang. The things in his
house that he had accounted beautiful must now
court comparison with a slip of a girl, who to her
uncle’s mind was the very first expression of beauty.
Imagine, then, his chagrin when, one night at a
ball, a friend of his, who had bought for him many
of his treasures, who was known to be a judge of
beauty, pronounced Diana attractive and fascinating
without being strictly beautiful. If a connoisseur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
had found his Charles II chalice a copy
he could not have felt more keenly the affront. If
he had been a child he would have said, “Shan’t
play any more,” so deeply was he hurt. Seeing a
nice-looking, pretty woman sitting by herself, with
an expression on her face as though she were singing
hymns to her babies in bed, he went up and
spoke to her. He knew her, of course, but did not
always find time to speak to her, for she never
gathered a crowd and he hated to be conspicuous—unless
at the same time distinguished.</p>

<p>“I am with my niece,” he said, sitting down.</p>

<p>“And which is your niece?” she asked, turning
her kind eyes towards him. She seemed to hold up
her tiara by the force of uplifted eyebrows. Marcus
showed her.</p>

<p>“That lovely thing!” she exclaimed with a
generous enthusiasm, and Marcus felt a tingle all
down his spine and an inclination to cry. How could
any man with a pretension to taste have pronounced
her fascinating without being strictly
beautiful?</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said; “you admire her?”</p>

<p>“Admire her! Could I do anything else?”</p>

<p>“If you were less beautiful yourself—yes!”
said Marcus, with a rush of gratitude.</p>

<p>To say the little woman was astonished does not
express in the least what she felt, but she was as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
shaken as was Marcus by the hysterical outburst.
He felt he could never trust himself again.</p>

<p>He had told quite the wrong kind of woman she
was beautiful.</p>

<p>He wasn’t happy again until he had drawn
Diana’s attention to the little woman and asked
her what she thought of her.</p>

<p>“That dear little Madonna? Why, she’s exactly
what Aunt Elsie goes second-class to Italy to gaze
upon—the type exactly. Do go and tell her she’s
beautiful. It’s all she needs.”</p>

<p>“I have,” said Marcus.</p>

<p>“Stout heart!” said Diana, patting his arm.</p>

<p>Marcus found it necessary and expedient to pass
the little woman again to see if she had recovered,
and he found her asleep under her tiara. He would
have passed on, but she awoke. “It’s so late, isn’t it?
But they must enjoy themselves, mustn’t they?”</p>

<p>Marcus said it seemed imperative nowadays.</p>

<p>“You are a very lucky uncle,” said the little
woman.</p>

<p>Again that curious feeling in the spine, like the
running down of cold water, assailed Marcus. “I
am,” he agreed.</p>

<p>“He’s so perfectly charming and delightful—”</p>

<p>“Who?” The feeling of flappiness changed to
one of apprehension.</p>

<p>The little woman looked: Marcus’s eyes followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
hers, and saw standing in the doorway a tall man,
on whose arm rested the hand of a great personage.
Up the stairs which were straight opposite the
doorway came a figure in white—the radiant
figure of a niece. In her face he thought was all the
joy in the world, concentrated into one look. That
look, he feared, was captured and kept by the
younger of the two men. The elder man, with an
amused gesture and a look of kind understanding,
walked away.</p>

<p>“Her mother, all over again,” groaned Marcus.</p>

<p>As they drove home together—radiant niece,
discomfited uncle—he said nothing, and she said:
“You funny old thing.” Then there was a pause.
She put out one slim foot (she had kicked off her
satin shoe) and rested it on the seat opposite.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t do that, Diana, if you were
driving with a strange man—would you?” he
asked anxiously, handing her the shoe.</p>

<p>“I might—but of course I should have to marry
him—according to your creed. The world of your
making, Marcus, must be a very dangerous place
to live in. It must be difficult in your world to
avoid pitfalls. The sins are many. In a world of my
making there would be sins, of course,—lying and
cheating, meanness,—they should be great sins.
Greater sins should be jealousy—unkindness to
children—and that’s all for to-day, thank you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>“My dear Diana, there is a very big sin about
which you probably know nothing and it has its
beginnings in what you call—”</p>

<p>Diana laid her hand on his. “Marcus,” she said,
“think, wouldn’t the sin of which you are thinking
come under the head possibly of unkindness to
children—?”</p>

<p>“My dear child, your ideas are very curious.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you think about things. I know
so little of young people.”</p>

<p>“What can I tell? My religion? I am a broad-minded
Christian.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I know. Of course, I know that, dear
child.”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“Which what?”</p>

<p>“That I am broad-minded or that I am a
Christian?”</p>

<p>“A Christian, and it’s as well to be broad-minded,
without being too broad-minded.”</p>

<p>“There are many ways to Heaven; I must choose
one. Is that it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I don’t see what you want with new
religions.”</p>

<p>“You think the well-worn narrow path the better
way—the path down which two can’t go
abreast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t mean religion exactly; that goes without
saying.”</p>

<p>“Does it? Yes, I think you are right. One can’t
say much about what one most feels, can one?”</p>

<p>“Your ideas about life generally is more what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Life? What life? Which life? This everyday
dancing life—or the life that comes later?”</p>

<p>“The life that comes later—your life. What
life do you look forward to?” If Marcus imagined
Diana looked forward to a life wherein visits to
Uncle Marcus on Sundays were things of delirious
delight, he was likely to be disappointed.</p>

<p>“Oh, I see—well, I suppose when I have danced
a great deal and frivolled a great deal—and cried
a great deal—and laughed a great deal—I shall
marry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what I mean, I suppose.” The Sunday
visits after all were not so improbable. He
would have every conceivable clockwork toy in the
cupboard. “Now what are your ideas of marriage—just
having a good time?”</p>

<p>“Partly; of course, I should like a pearl necklace—or
a rope, perhaps—and three babies.”</p>

<p>“And what sort of a mother would you be?”</p>

<p>“A good, hard-working, honest mother, of
course—”</p>

<p>“Hard-working?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“I should work hard to make them good babies.”</p>

<p>“And their father? What sort of a man should
he be?”</p>

<p>“Like my father, if another exists.”</p>

<p>The vision of visits on Sundays faded away, the
clockwork toys were put back in the cupboard,
they wouldn’t go—not one of them.</p>

<p>“Your father? Is he your ideal?”</p>

<p>“Of course—there is no one like him.”</p>

<p>“And for this man who is to be so good, you will
keep yourself—good?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Diana passionately,
her eyes shining, her cheeks aflame.</p>

<p>In a moment Marcus was humble, explaining
eagerly that he was only trying to find out—if
these friendships between boys and girls were good
things—and wise? He had been frightened—</p>

<p>“By dowagers,” said Diana; “why do you go
and sit among them and gossip? Why don’t you
say straight out, ‘Diana, would you let a man kiss
you?’ Say it—be quick—or I shall go.”</p>

<p>She held the speaking-tube to her lips, threatening;
Marcus was dumb.</p>

<p>“Stop!” she commanded, and Tooke, the chauffeur,
obeyed.</p>

<p>She opened the door of the car and stepped out—into
the street. It all happened in a second before
Marcus realized what she was going to do. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
followed her as quickly as he could, but she was
too quick for him. What a sight for London—he
thought—at four o’clock on a summer’s morning:
the day dawning—or dawned—and into the arms
of the rising sun, like a leaf blown by the wind,
hardly seeming to touch the ground, flew Diana—to
Marcus’s astonished vision a whirl of white tulle
and long legs; and after her ran he—Marcus
Maitland, uncle, bachelor, taxpayer, and citizen.
Behind him he heard the hoot of a horn and the
car stopped. “Better get in, sir; you can’t go the
pace and Miss Diana will tire. Very good, sir—”
This at an impatient gesture from Mr. Maitland,
and Marcus went on, Tooke not driving fast enough
to catch the niece fleeing, or slow enough to witness
the discomfiture of the uncle pursuing. When Marcus
arrived at his door he presumed he would find
a beaten and humbled niece, unable to get in: but
he found the door wide open, a detestable habit of
hers: she must have had her key. He went into the
hall—listened. Not a sound; he stole upstairs and
listened. He heard a sound of running water—it
was Diana’s bath filling. He was very, very angry
with her. She was like her aunt—exactly like; he
had known that aunt was a violent woman.</p>

<p>He went to bed and he slept badly. A few hours
later, with his morning tea Pillar brought him a
note. He opened it and read:</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You have trespassed where an uncle may not go—there
are places in our hearts that are barred,
even to mothers, and mothers know it and understand.
I know, dear old thing, you don’t realize
how big your feet are or how heavily you tread.
You have squashed all sorts of little plants that
were beginning to grow in my heart—that’s a
pity, you know! Aunt Elsie never trespasses, for
all her violence. You have lived too long in your
narrow world, dear old Marcus. A world in which
no man can be trusted at all and women only a
little. I have become more distrustful of men since
I lived with you than I ever was before. You will
say that is what you wish. But it is not what I wish.
Why are you and Aunt Elsie both afraid of the
opposite sex? Aunt Elsie is frightened if she meets
a drunken bricklayer in a lane after sundown. Why?
You are just as afraid of a woman. Why? I would
rather go round the world alone with a man than
with a woman. I shan’t do it because it’s not done—as
they say. But Dick says there should be no
possible harm in it.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>When Marcus came down to breakfast he was
as silent, as quiet, as a heron fishing on the shore
of a Highland loch—and as shy. He was sure
Diana would put her arms round his neck and forgive
him—and ask his forgiveness. (He was an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
old-fashioned uncle.) But no Diana came. When
he told Pillar to send up word that—Pillar said
Miss Diana had been called very early—in fact
had not been to bed, he believed—and had gone—</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To Miss Carston, sir.”</p>

<p>“How did she go?”</p>

<p>“The car, sir; it happened—Tooke chanced to
be about; after all, it’s the best way of going, sir,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“When Tooke returns I want to see him.”</p>

<p>The joys of living alone were once more Marcus’s.
What were they? There was no one to seize the
coffee-pot when he wanted it; to ask him whom
his letters were from; to read him bits out of the
paper; bits he didn’t want to hear; bits he had
read the evening before. There was no one to discuss
plans that could never come off. There were
no engagements read out to him, between people
he had never heard of—at all events, by the
names of Toddy and Doddy and Buffy and Bunny.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there were things he missed.
She had amused him. Her girl friends had seemed
to him amazing people: her boy friends not less
amazing. Their spirits were wonderful, their ways
past finding out, their ingenuity remarkable, their
patronage almost tender in its pity. Diana and her
friends were no more. Pillar remained. And in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
country lived Miss Carston and to her Diana had
gone—in his car!</p>

<p>That evening entered Pillar. “Tooke is here,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Send him in,” said Marcus, glad that his anger
had in no way grown less during the day.</p>

<p>Entered Tooke, cap in hand. A chauffeur unarmed:
he said nothing, of course. But there was
a look in his eyes that said as clearly as though he
had spoken it—as man to man: “What would
you have done in my place? What would you have
done if she had arst you?”</p>

<p>A capless, unarmed chauffeur, yet armed to the
eyes—invulnerable was Tooke.</p>

<p>“Tooke?”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Car run well?”</p>

<p>“Fine, sir.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking, Tooke, that we ought to have
a lining made if Miss Diana is going much into
the country—what is the stuff? You know—kind
of drill, isn’t it? It would save the lining; see
to it, will you?”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir. A detachable lining, I take it
you mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Elsie Carston</span> grew restless. It was all very
well that Diana should go to London to have
a good time, but the season in London was over.
There was nothing left for Diana to do but find
the streets hot and the parks empty. To be with
Mr. Maitland could not in any way be called a
pleasure. Diana was wonderfully loyal to her uncle.
Elsie was glad of that. She wouldn’t have had the
child otherwise, but that it was loyalty that prevented
her really saying what she thought of him,
she knew. It could be nothing else. She was glad
she had said to Diana when she had left for
London: “Now, Diana, remember, whatever you
think of your uncle, you mustn’t say it—even
to me. He means to be very kind.”</p>

<p>Diana had implicitly obeyed her aunt. Loyally
she had persisted that he was a dear. Elsie, of
course, knew he could not be that, but she knew
that uncles with money are people to propitiate—one
cannot afford to treat them as they should be
treated.</p>

<p>“When’s Diana comin’?” asked Shan’t, at
breakfast, over the edge of her porridge-bowl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>“That was just what I was wondering, Shan’t.”</p>

<p>“Why do you wonder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, exactly; why, my child?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“You’ve said that before.”</p>

<p>“And I shall probably say it again.”</p>

<p>Poor Aunt Elsie, thought Shan’t, she was feeling
the heat—that is what makes people cross.</p>

<p>“Why?” she repeated—in order to find out if
Aunt Elsie was really cross or only just pretending.</p>

<p>“Because I want to.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we went on saying ‘Why?’ forever—what
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">d’you suppose would happen?”</span></p>

<p>Aunt Elsie didn’t answer, so Shan’t knew she
was really cross. “I want Diana,” she said plaintively.</p>

<p>“We all want Diana,” answered Aunt Elsie
snappily.</p>

<p>“Won’t she ever come?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“She hasn’t gone to Heaven, then—or anything
awful like that?” suggested Shan’t cheerfully.</p>

<p>“My dear Shan’t, what an awful idea!—I
mean—it isn’t really an awful idea—I didn’t
mean that—”</p>

<p>“Goin’ to Heaven is ge’rally called, ‘Oh, that
will be joyful,’ isn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, dear—shall I write and ask Diana if she
is coming?”</p>

<p>Shan’t nodded; then she jumped up and down
in her chair and did dangerous things with her
spoon, and the porridge within the spoon, and the
only-aunt-in-the-world had to tell her to sit still
and to put her spoon down or to finish her porridge.
It is extraordinary the dulness of the alternatives
grown-ups offer children, always ending up with
“or else.”</p>

<p>“Or else what?” ask the children, always hoping,
perhaps, that the grown-ups will think of
something new—going to bed early, no jam for
tea, are ridden to death. There is no child that
doesn’t despair at the lack of enterprise shown by
grown-ups in the inventing of punishments for
crimes which are not strictly punishable. Why
shouldn’t Shan’t, if she chose, wave her spoon in
the air at the thought of Diana’s return? She didn’t
make the porridge: it wasn’t her fault it was made
wet and squashy—and splashable about.</p>

<p>“I will ask her,” said Aunt Elsie; and she meant
it, too, and if she just mentioned the prospect of
a dance—was it not perfectly justifiable? She had
not suggested it. If Mrs. Sloane chose—to be so
kind—</p>

<p>Aunt Elsie went to her writing-table and she
wrote until she found Shan’t biting the edge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
table. Then she left off writing to show Shan’t the
teeth-marks she had made. Shan’t was intensely
interested, but not in the least surprised. Why,
she was making them on purpose all the time!
Didn’t Aunt Elsie think she was? It was then
Aunt Elsie determined that Uncle Marcus should
have his furniture bitten. It would do him all the
good in the world. To her letter she added a post-script—“Tell
Mr. Maitland he can have Shan’t
for a few days if he likes. This is, I believe, the
arrangement we made. She can then return a few
days before you come back—” And Elsie folded
the letter, feeling she was doing the right and
honourable thing—while Shan’t, with her chin
resting on the edge of the table, made tiger faces
at her. Aunt Elsie knew Mr. Maitland gave large
sums for furniture and that his furniture consisted
of “pieces.” Shan’t should set her mark upon
them.</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened and in walked
Diana.</p>

<p>“Darlings!” she cried, snatching up Shan’t and
putting her on Aunt Elsie’s lap so that she might
hug them both together and so make up for lost
time.</p>

<p>“Why did you come?” asked Aunt Elsie; “not
that; but how did you get away?”</p>

<p>“Quite easily.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“You haven’t—?”</p>

<p>“Of course not: he’s a dear, but London is hot—and
Shan’t is a darling and the only-aunt-in-the-world—is—”</p>

<p>“I am just offering him Shan’t,” said Aunt Elsie.</p>

<p>“Writing to him?”</p>

<p>“No, I was writing to you—”</p>

<p>“Well, write to him; say I have arrived. Say I
look so well—”</p>

<p>“You do, darling—you do!”</p>

<p>“Yes—and add that you can’t take Shan’t to
the seaside this year.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do—take me to the seaside,” moaned
Shan’t.</p>

<p>“You tell Uncle Marcus that Aunt Elsie won’t
take you to the seaside, Shan’t, poor little thing!”</p>

<p>“Don’t say <em>won’t</em>,” said Aunt Elsie.</p>

<p>“What shall I say, then?” asked Shan’t.</p>

<p>“Say <em>won’t</em>,” said Diana.</p>

<p>“She won’t—she won’t—she wo-n’t,” murmured
Shan’t.</p>

<p>“It is delightful to have you back,” said Aunt
Elsie, as arm in arm she and Diana went round the
garden, leaving Shan’t to write to Uncle Marcus—a
rash thing to do—“with re-al ink,” sighed
Shan’t.</p>

<p>It was rather curious, but that very morning
Mr. Pease, remembering what Mrs. Sloane had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
said, determined to go and sit in Miss Carston’s
garden. He quite saw it was the politic thing to do.
Then Miss Carston couldn’t think what she would
be almost bound to think—</p>

<p>Mr. Watkins had thought over that brambly,
overgrown path to which Mrs. Sloane had referred.
At last he remembered the source from which the
idea had flowed. It was from a Persian poem. Any
idea Mr. Watkins must always run to ground. If
any new idea were to burst upon Bestways it must
come from him. He could bear a woman to be anything
rather than original. He would have talked
more if he could have afforded to. But his thoughts
were to him as valuable as jewels, he must keep
them until he could be paid for them. He couldn’t
afford to be amusing like ordinary people. But
still the thought that had inspired Mrs. Sloane
had been a wise one—Of course, if he only went
to Miss Carston’s garden when Miss Diana was
there, Miss Carston would think—that he only
went—what would she think? He would therefore
go at once. So by three o’clock on the day Diana
came home two men had passed through the garden
gate, and the first person they each came upon,
of course, was Diana.</p>

<p>Mr. Pease was the first to find her. “You here!”
he exclaimed. “Well—I am—surprised—I mean
I really am—do you know why I came to-day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Diana had no idea.</p>

<p>“Because I thought you weren’t here.”</p>

<p>There was a pause. “Why are you laughing,
Miss Diana? I mean I came because you weren’t
here, so that I might come when you were.”</p>

<p>“I see!”</p>

<p>“Do you, really?”</p>

<p>And Mr. Pease hastened to say that if he
only came when she was there it would look
as if—</p>

<p>“You came to see me?”</p>

<p>Mr. Pease said he felt he had somehow or other
not said quite what he meant to say.</p>

<p>Diana quickly assured him she knew exactly
what he had meant to say—that he really came
to see Aunt Elsie, but that if he waited till Aunt
Elsie had her niece back, then it would look as if
it was the niece he had wanted to see. It was very
clever of him—and Aunt Elsie would never
suspect.</p>

<p>“That isn’t in the least what I meant; it was
rather the other way round.”</p>

<p>“And Mr. Watkins, why does he come to sit in
Aunt Elsie’s garden?”</p>

<p>Across the lawn, towards the fount of his inspiration,
knowing not she was there, came Mr.
Watkins, murmuring as he walked: smiling as apt
phrases broke from his lips—“rippling rhythmetic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
phrases,” he would have called them. He spoke to
his sisters, the bees; sang to his brothers, the birds;
conscious all the while of the suitability of his
garb and the length of his hair. If Diana were but
there to see! Diana was there and she saw, and she
looked at Mr. Pease. Mr. Pease looked away. He
carried Christianity to the length of never making
fun of another less well placed than himself, and
well placed he now was; next to Diana. And Diana,
as she sat, had no other side. A matter for congratulation
to any man, or child, who loves. To
halve sides may mean an acute mental agony. On
Diana’s other side rose a pillar of rambling roses,
of which no man could be jealous. Mr. Pease had
not got so far as to be jealous of the breezes that
played in his lady’s hair, or of the roses that fluttered
their petals over her. He left such things to
Watkins.</p>

<p>“Well, Watkins?” he said.</p>

<p>“Is it <em>well</em>?” questioned Watkins, from despondent
habit; then he caught sight of Diana. The
spring went from his walk, the lilt from his voice.
She had come back and Pease had known she was
coming. Pease without a sense of honour was no
longer his friend—the past must be as though it
had never been. Never again would he confide in
Pease: never again read him his poems: share his
Sunday sausages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“This is delightful!” he said, looking first at
Pease, then at the pillar of roses that stood as it
were on Diana’s left hand; finally he sank down
at Diana’s feet. “Now tell me—everything,” he
said; “what saw you in London?”</p>

<p>“Men and things—things and men,” said
Diana.</p>

<p>“Just men?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just men, and unjust—poets and policemen.”</p>

<p>“Bad poets?”</p>

<p>“Bad poets.”</p>

<p>“And what did the poets do?”</p>

<p>“One sold bootlaces for a living.”</p>

<p>“And does he yet live?”</p>

<p>“No, he died.”</p>

<p>“Who got the bootlaces?”</p>

<p>“The policeman got the bootlaces.”</p>

<p>“Who gave him—a button-hook?” asked
Shan’t, remembering that Uncle Marcus could
not lace or unlace his boots without one.</p>

<p>“What a strange thing,” said Mr. Watkins.
“Out of the mouth of babes and—and yet—why
strange? Strange that it should be true that
out of the—”</p>

<p>“Aren’t we getting in a bit deep?” asked Mr.
Pease, who felt that the poet was trespassing on
his ground. Poets in general he handed over to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
Watkins to play with as he liked, but the Bible—and
as a future bishop—button-hooks—well,
after all, they were his province.</p>

<p>“What nonsense we talk!” said Diana; “I propose
we go in to tea.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> ought to propose,” said Shan’t to Mr.
Pease; “you could if you liked—and <em>you</em>,” she
said, nodding at Mr. Watkins; “couldn’t they,
Diana?”</p>

<p>“They might.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” Shan’t said, turning to Mr. Pease;
“do let him, Diana.”</p>

<p>Diana thought it better not. It was too hot—too
delicious a day altogether to spoil.</p>

<p>Shan’t was very disappointed. She slipped her
hand into that of the curate. “<em>You</em> do—” she
whispered,—“it would be such fun. Then you
could be married—wouldn’t you like it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Pease said he would like it very much—only
people never did propose on Wednesdays.</p>

<p>“On what days, then?”</p>

<p>“Only on Saturday afternoons—at half-past
three—on half-holidays—”</p>

<p>“Truthfully?”</p>

<p>“More or less—”</p>

<p>“I am going to the seaside,” said Shan’t, “with
my darling uncle”—this unctuously.</p>

<p>“Are you? That will be delightful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>“I thought you were goin’ to say, ‘Oh, that will
be joyful,’ but that’s about dying, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Pease thought it was.</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s such a very joyful thing to
die?”</p>

<p>Mr. Pease hesitated. He had no wish to die. He
raised his eyes to the heavens above him: they
looked their best, he was sure, from where he stood:
his eyes to the waving tree-tops; they had not
whispered half the secrets they had to tell him. He
looked at the daisy-sown lawn; at Diana who
walked a few paces in front of him; at Shan’t who
walked beside him. He didn’t want to die; he
wanted desperately to live. To live till that day
when he should be asked to pay the bill for some
blue stuff such as Shan’t’s frock was made of.
Blue stuff like that must be fairly cheap. It was
not much to aspire to—the blue cottony stuff,
he meant! His grasp tightened on the hand of
Shan’t.</p>

<p>“You do squeeze hard,” she said—“it makes
my hand so hot, like when you hold daisies, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I was afraid I might lose you,” he explained,
releasing her hand.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t run away, it would be rude—wouldn’t
it? Only if I go to the sea—that won’t
be so very rude—” Then she added: “I didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
want to leave go—not specially.” She slipped her
hand in his.</p>

<p>“That would be different,” said Mr. Pease, referring
to the visit to the seaside.</p>

<p>“Why would it be?”</p>

<p>“Because—the sea is always different from
anything else in the world. There will be deep,
deep golden sands at the sea—there are none
here—and there will be crabs and starfish—and
babies of all sizes—and shapes—round and
square—think of that!”</p>

<p>“Squ-are?” queried Shan’t; “I don’t think they
could be that.”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think their mothers would let them.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right.”</p>

<p>“Gardens are square in London—aren’t they?”</p>

<p>Mr. Pease said, of course they were. Perhaps he
was thinking of square gardens.</p>

<p>“What else will there be at the sea?”</p>

<p>“There will be coast-guardsmen.”</p>

<p>“What are they like?”</p>

<p>“They are great big men—and they have
beards—and they look through telescopes—and
they never tell you what they see.”</p>

<p>“Not if you asked them very nicely, wouldn’t
they?”</p>

<p>“No, not even then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“P’r’aps they don’t see anything.”</p>

<p>“I believe you have lighted on a great truth.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“What’s what?”</p>

<p>“What you said.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Let’s play something else. You be funny—or
something—or shall we <em>just</em> have tea?”</p>

<p>Mr. Pease thought, just have tea. It was so
much easier than being funny.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Watkins thought he had proposed
to Diana and was in an agony of mind not
knowing whether she knew it or not. If she did not
know it, he thought he would leave things alone.
But if she knew he had proposed, he would be
equally willing to let things stand. Glad to let them!
But he had been rushed, as it were, into a declaration.
The perfidy of Pease had upset him; the
prettiness of Diana had distracted him. And yet
he had always vowed that nothing should ever
induce him to marry a pretty woman. True beauty
must be strange: must not be admired of the people—or
understood by the crowd. He would rather
be one of those who admired “the other sister far
more.” It showed discrimination: argued a critical
faculty. Diana was too obviously pretty. He didn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
suppose any one had ever argued the point. Therefore
she did not come up to what he had set as his
standard. But still, if he had proposed—he was
quite glad—quite. It was possible he had been so
subtle, disguised his meaning so cleverly that
Diana had not seen whither he was drifting. Mr.
Watkins decided to go by the size of the tea she
was able to eat.</p>

<p>Diana was able to eat quite a good tea. The
colour in her cheeks neither deepened nor paled,
and she forgot whether Mr. Watkins liked sugar
or not in his tea. So he decided he had carried
subtlety too far. Or perhaps it had served him well.
He would be better able to judge of that later on.
To-morrow morning! After proposing he had always
heard it was the next morning that tells.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Night had come. Shan’t had been asleep for
hours. Diana was asleep. Only Aunt Elsie was
awake—and she asked of herself this question—“Is
she in love and has she told <em>him</em>?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><em>He</em>, alone in London, asked of himself the same
question: “Is she in love—and has she told <em>her</em>?”
If he had known that Aunt Elsie lay awake, as he
lay awake, wondering, he would have been happier.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In a Government House far, far away, two people
asked of each other the same question. The red<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
carpet was rolled up, the band had gone to bed,
the tiara was taken off, and the A.D.C.’s were no
longer “studies in scarlet and gold,” but were presumably
asleep, dreaming of trout streams and
England; and Sibyl and her husband sat together—Sibyl
with her hair in two long plaits looking
absurdly like Diana. Her husband loved her like
that. It amused him to see how young she looked.
And the dinner? How had it gone off? They did not
talk of dinners. They sat for some time saying
nothing. The air was heavy with the scent of
flowers, a breeze blew through the open windows.
“What is Diana doing?” asked Sibyl. “No, don’t
bother about the difference in time. Supposing
it is <em>there</em> what it is <em>here</em>—what is she doing?”</p>

<p>Her father hoped she was in bed.</p>

<p>Diana in bed! Countless memories there—delicious
memories. Memories that brought tears to
the mother’s eyes—and because of the tears in her
eyes, to the father’s eyes too.</p>

<p>“And—Dick?”</p>

<p>Again they were both silent. They were never so
silent as when they talked of their children—there
was so much to say.</p>

<p>“And Shan’t?”</p>

<p>There was another silence; then Sibyl said: “I
wonder if she is in love?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s possible at her age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>“She’s nineteen.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t seem possible.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes hope she will marry—”</p>

<p>“He’s not good enough.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know who I was going to say?”</p>

<p>“It makes no difference,” said Diana’s father.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>And one of the aides-de-camp asked of himself
the same question. “Is she in love?” and he was
properly and horribly and happily miserable.</p>

<p>Before he got into bed he took from his despatch-case
a photograph (he had stolen it, by the way)
and put it on the table beside his bed. “Good-night,
you darling,” he whispered; “you’ll wait
till you’ve seen me, won’t you? I mean—you’ll
give me a chance before you fall in love?” And he
fell asleep, thinking, and he slept, dreaming, of
Diana. And Diana hardly knew of his existence—never
dreamed that the prayers of an A.D.C.
committed her every night to God’s safe keeping,
until he should be able to keep guard over her
himself.</p>

<p>Her mother had mentioned once or twice that
Captain Hastings was fond of weeding.</p>

<p>Captain Hastings would not have slept so well
as he did had he known that was all Lady Carston
had said about him. He hated weeding—except
as a means to an end. What had she done, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
would have asked, with all the beautiful things he
had said about love and marriage and life in general,
and His Excellency in particular, if she had
not sent them on to her whose photograph had
inspired them?</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Diana</span> wrote to her uncle and said poor Shan’t
wanted to go to the seaside, but Aunt Elsie
could not manage to take her there. Poor little
Shan’t! She did so love the sea, and her legs were
so pale!</p>

<p>“Selfish woman,” said Marcus; “why couldn’t
she make an effort?” To some children the seaside
was an absolute necessity. If she wouldn’t
he would, and he wrote and said so.</p>

<p>From then onwards, until the day came on
which he took Shan’t to the seaside, he lay awake
at night pondering on many things—buttons
and strings—hooks and eyes—strings and buttons—hooks
and strings—buttons and eyes—and
he wondered if there were any place at which
an uncle—anxious to learn—could be instructed
in the dressing and undressing of a small niece on
the sands—under the shadow of an upturned
boat—on the beach of a favourite watering-place?
Would it be possible to go to a watering-place that
was not a favourite? Then as he fell asleep there
rose before his closing eyes the vision of a house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
on wheels—cream to palish pink in colour—which
boasted of two side windows and dropped
steps from its front door. He had seen such
buildings years ago—bathing-machines! And in a
bathing-machine the uncle found shelter. They
are safer, and wiser and better things, than aunts.
Where Aunt Elsie might have helped him, the
bathing-machine got him out of a difficulty, and
protected him.</p>

<p>Marcus Maitland had forgotten what the seaside
was like. It compared in no way with the
shores of a sea loch in Scotland—where the peace
and beauty are indescribable; where he had many
a time watched the swift sweep of the gulls on the
wing—the diving of terns. He had seen seals
swimming about—wise old men of the sea. He
had heard, up on the hill, the croak of the raven;
had seen the shadow on the hillside of an eagle’s
wings: and there were no babies. An uncle could
sit at peace: with no violent aunt in the background.
But a favourite watering-place! It was
hotter than he had remembered it—more glaring:
the people on the beach were less attractive: the
babies less pink and less plentiful than the advertisements
had promised. Not less plentiful in a
way, but they did not stretch right across the
beach away to the horizon, hand in hand, nor did
they smile at him an invitation to arise and bathe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
They squatted in groups about the sand, making
castle puddings. Nurses knelt beside them. Nannies,
with rugs and bags and baskets, and bottles—and
mackintoshes even, and umbrellas, on hot days;
and large quantities of white needle-work—garments
for the children. It distressed Marcus to
think that all this time there was nothing being
made for Shan’t. All along the beach, so far as he
could see, nurses sewed. Her wardrobe would get
terribly out of date. But she didn’t seem to mind;
she was very happy. The tucking-in of petticoats
had been less difficult than Marcus had imagined:
in fact he began to wonder if these things came
naturally to men, as they were supposed to come
to women. Perhaps in all men there lay dormant
the paternal instinct. Certainly, whether the instinct
were there or not, he took to this sort of
thing amazingly naturally. That he looked the
part he never thought. He knew himself to be an
uncle, so never thought of himself as anything else.</p>

<p>A mother and daughter began to take notice of
Shan’t. One morning they smiled at her and Shan’t
smiled back, all over her small person. There was
no exclusiveness about this, the younger of his
nieces. Diana did at times put her small head up
in the air and walk as though the whole world belonged
to her—but Shan’t—never! She belonged
to the whole world—quite another thing. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
next morning the mother smiled again and the
daughter dropped her book. Whereas Shan’t
would promptly have buried it in the sand, Marcus
felt bound to pick it up and restore it to its glowing
owner. He was thanked by the young woman with
a warmth that surprised him. Her voice throbbed
with thankfulness, so much so that he wished he
had looked at the title of the book. Was the
tribute to the author?</p>

<p>The following morning Marcus would have
chosen another place in the sun, but Shan’t liked
her old haunts—there was a darlin’ crab—she
had promised it to come back—faithfully. Uncle
Marcus sought to assure her that where a crab was
one day, it was not bound to be the next. The sea
took it out—right out!</p>

<p>“Right out—right out,” said Shan’t, and she
looked so like crying over the departure of the crab
seawards that he made for the spot where it had
been, and, of course (so hard on uncles this sort of
thing!) there was a crab, “in the very same place”—so
Shan’t said—“and,” she added, “it was a
darlin’ and it looked so pleased to see me—it
smiled!”</p>

<p>This kind of thing, too, it was that distressed
Marcus. Ought he, as uncle, to tell her that crabs
did not smile, or should he leave it alone. “It’s a
darlin’,” she repeated. She stood looking at him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
in grave displeasure—looked at him under her
eyelashes. He had lied. The sea had not taken her
darlin’ crab away. She knew it hadn’t. The sea
had been falsely accused. Shan’t was ever on the
side of the injured. The mother and daughter came
along and found Marcus standing thus being
judged of Shan’t, and this time they both smiled.</p>

<p>“What a darling!” said the younger of the two
women, and Shan’t turned and frowned at her.
“Aren’t you?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“No,” said Shan’t.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Shan’t-if-I-don’t-want-to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, please, if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“It’s that,” said Shan’t.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Shan’t-if-I-don’t—want—to.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to,” said the girl with infinite
patience—maternal patience, if Marcus
could but have appreciated it. The mother looked
to see if it were lost upon the man—and saw it
was lost. Therefore she sat down beside Marcus,
and Shan’t and the girl—friends by this time—were
told to run and play.</p>

<p>The mother opened her sunshade and turned a
deeply sympathetic face towards a very miserable
and bewildered Marcus. This wasn’t the kind of
woman with whom he was at ease. She made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
shy, which was a thing he was not accustomed to
be. He made other people shy as a rule.</p>

<p>“She’s a dear little child,” said the unwelcome
woman.</p>

<p>“She is,” said Marcus. “Do you mind if I
smoke?” He had found smoking as efficacious
against some kinds of women as it is said to be
against some kinds of insects—what kinds has
not as yet been specified.</p>

<p>“I love it—my daughter is so fond of it.” Seeing
Marcus’s look of indifference, perhaps of repugnance—she
could not tell which—she added for
safety, “The smell of it.”</p>

<p>“Umph,” said Marcus.</p>

<p>“How old is she?”</p>

<p>“Your daughter?” asked Marcus.</p>

<p>And the mother laughed. “How amusing you are!
And yet you don’t feel it, do you? you don’t look it.”</p>

<p>“Umph!”</p>

<p>“My daughter and I said how sad you looked—your
whole life, we could see, is centred in that
child.”</p>

<p>“Not entirely,” said Marcus, thinking of his
collections.</p>

<p>“No? But still for a man alone it is a great
responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got some one with me, thank you, to help—a
housemaid, her father’s a coast-guardsman.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>“Of course, yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s the buttons and things, on the beach.”</p>

<p>“Of course, yes. Is she like her mother?”</p>

<p>“Like her mother? Yes, I suppose she is—wider
between the eyes, perhaps—a little.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the tragedies of life!” A pause, then she
added: “Was she taken early?”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“Her mother—that sacred name.”</p>

<p>“Her mother is abroad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really, I see, of course. We never thought
of that. A man alone with a child always suggests—”</p>

<p>“What?” He was really interested. How he appeared
to others was a subject that always held
him.</p>

<p>“A widower—bereavement.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I’m not a widower, far from it—”</p>

<p>The mother found the sun too hot, she must go;
she rose, called to her daughter, and they went on,
little knowing that, although they had not found
a widower, they had found a bachelor, which is in
some ways a far better thing—</p>

<p>“Nice lady,” said Shan’t decisively, pouring
sand from her spade on to Marcus’s shoes.</p>

<p>“What did she talk about?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Cwabs.”</p>

<p>“What did she say about crabs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“She said—there was one called Penepoly—I
think it was—and she was very nice indeed—and
she’s dead, so we buried her—and we aren’t
goin’ to be sad about it because it is happier for
her, because her—husband is dead too—and
there aren’t any children—at least not many—There
was lots more, only I forget—she was very
silly, really.”</p>

<p>“Am I silly, Shan’t?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Shan’t; then seizing him round the
neck she ecstatically hugged him.</p>

<p>After Shan’t’s prayers were said there lay a long
evening before Marcus. He made Shan’t’s going to
bed as late as he dared with the housemaid on the
watch. It could hardly be made to last over seven
o’clock—and then it was over-late, so the housemaid
said. Shan’t was inclined to lengthen her day
by means of inordinate praying. The prayers ran
on to an extraordinary length. Uncle Marcus
could not know that Aunt Elsie strictly limited
the number of people prayed for. When Shan’t
got down to postmen what posted letters, and
cwabs what went to sea—and old gentlemen who
hadn’t got any buns, and old ladies who hadn’t
got any cake—and po-or little children who
hadn’t got any bull’s-eyes, Uncle Marcus should
have brought her up with a round turn; but he let
her wander on till she came to her darlin’ Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Elsie, when he said it was time to stop. “One more,
please,” said Shan’t; and she shut her eyes tight
and prayed: “Please God, give me a nice donkey
ride to-morrow morning at ten o’clock sharp.”
She waited, then said, “Thank you,” bowed, and
turning to Marcus said triumphantly: “God says
he <em>will</em>.”</p>

<p>And Marcus gave her the nice donkey ride the
next morning at ten o’clock—sharp.</p>

<p>After Shan’t was in bed and asleep, Marcus
took to walking on the sea-front and there he met
again the daughter of the mother. She was certainly
an attractive girl—and she said she found
him sympathetic and understanding. This was
gratifying in the extreme to Marcus—few can
withstand so subtle a form of appreciation. He
had imagined himself unsympathetic outwardly,
difficult to know; but at heart capable of intense
feeling. He is not the only man who has thus pictured
himself.</p>

<p>Then he took to meeting the girl accidentally by
day, surprising her reading, or gazing out to sea,
with the book on her lap upside down. Her eyes
were wonderfully expressive, full of a sadness she
did not feel. This she knew. Marcus did not.</p>

<p>In this manner, seeking to comfort where sorrow
was not, but only simple femininity, Marcus lost
Shan’t. Hurriedly he sought her: up and down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
beach, stooping to inspect closely the faces of bending
babies, entirely forgetting, it seemed, the age
and size of Shan’t. As he rushed along the sea-front,
he chanced upon an upturned perambulator.
It was in the charge of a small girl hardly bigger
than Shan’t, though possibly much older. She was
groping in the gutter, heedless of the baby’s
perilous position. “’Ave you seen ’is satisfoyer?”
asked the small woman-child of Marcus. Marcus
righted the perambulator, rearranged the baby in
the righted perambulator, and said he had not
seen the “satisfoyer.” But he searched for it,
found it: wiped it, and popped it into the baby’s
mouth, just as any lamentably ignorant nurse or
mother or woman-child might have done. But he
knew better: even mere man knows what danger
there lies to the future of England in the snare of
the “satisfoyer.” But Marcus was too busy to
think of the future of England and her citizens; he
was frightfully busy. He had just time to find the
baby’s “satisfoyer,” and to find the baby the
ugliest he had ever seen, and was off on his search
for Shan’t. What should he say to Sibyl if he should
fail to find her? To that detestable aunt? To Diana?</p>

<p>He found Shan’t in the process of being converted,
and she was enjoying it immensely. Her
eyes were cast heavenwards in an abandonment of
religious ecstasy: her mouth was rounded to its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
widest. She was singing a hymn: sharing a hymn-book
with a black man—not even a man black in
parts, as is commonly to be met at the seaside, but
a real black man.</p>

<p>Marcus watched in despair. For his niece he had
ceased to exist—only as part of this world had
she known him. She was translated to another: a
world where the sands were more golden, the sea
more glassy than they could ever be here on earth.</p>

<p>Marcus waited. Waited until Shan’t, with a
radiant smile, turned to the black man, thanked
him, folded her small hands, gloved in white cotton
gloves, the fingers of which turned up as only
white cotton fingers can, and gave herself up to
the sermon.</p>

<p>“Poor devil!” murmured Marcus, perhaps at
the thought of Shan’t’s extreme fairness.</p>

<p>In the middle of the sermon the attention of
Shan’t slackened: she swallowed: she removed her
gaze from the face of the preacher, just to look
around, to see, perhaps, if there were any little
boys less religious—or as religious—as herself,
and her eyes met those of her reproachful uncle.
Hers straightway became fixed on that far-away
something. Things have—in the history of the
world—looked as innocent as she looked: but
very few—among them puppies in chicken-yards.
She was absorbed in that far-away something—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
what gave her away was the pink flush which
stole over her little face, then flooded it. Tears
gathered in her eyes. But she still gazed bravely—intently—absorbedly.</p>

<p>Marcus walked round, behind the crowd, stooped
down behind her and whispered. She rose, and
putting her hand in his walked away with him.</p>

<p>“Did you like it, Shan’t?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “You see, I hadn’t got a
hymn-book of my own.”</p>

<p>“So I supposed,” he said stiffly.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> turned over.”</p>

<p>“Did you? Did you like the preacher?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He was rather silly, really.” Shan’t’s
usual summary, this.</p>

<p>“What did the preacher say?”</p>

<p>Shan’t hesitated—what <em>did</em> he say? “He said I
must love God—and not eat any more apples.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Marcus, not recognizing in this brief
summary the story of the Garden of Eden. He
didn’t believe “that aunt” would either.</p>

<p>“D’you think you’ll go to Heaven?” asked
Shan’t cheerfully.</p>

<p>Marcus humbly answered that he hoped he
might if he were very good.</p>

<p>“What will God call you?”</p>

<p>This Marcus didn’t know; couldn’t say; had
never thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>“‘Mis-ter Maitland’—or ‘Marcus’—which
would you like best?”</p>

<p>Marcus thought—his Christian name was
nicest—just as Shan’t said it.</p>

<p>“But the butler must say ‘Mister Maitland,’
mustn’t he?”</p>

<p>“What butler?”</p>

<p>“God’s butler,” said Shan’t, solemnly, rather
overcome at the thought of a personage so grand—so
awe-inspiring.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose God has a butler, Shan’t.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? Who are the Pillars of God’s
house, then? Nannie reads about them—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p>“There m-ust be, mustn’t there—because of
Pillar?”</p>

<p>“Of course there must be.”</p>

<p>“Will you give Pillar up to God for his house—if
God wanted him?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I should have to.”</p>

<p>“I expect he would do things for you—all the
same, when you go to Heaven, if God goes away
for a few days—and other times too?”</p>

<p>“Who, Pillar?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I expect he would.”</p>

<p>“He says you can’t do without him, so he’d
have to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>“Does he say that?” asked Marcus, feeling a glow
of absurd thankfulness permeating his being—</p>

<p>Shan’t nodded and said fervently that she liked
Pillar. Marcus had to assure her that he did, too,
and there the matter ended—so far as Shan’t was
concerned; but not for Marcus. He wasn’t superstitious,
but he wished Shan’t hadn’t broached
the subject of giving Pillar up to any one. Existence
without Pillar would be an impossibility.
That afternoon by letter Marcus raised the wages
of Pillar five pounds a year, and after listening to
Shan’t’s prayers asking God to bless Pillar, he
wished he had made it ten pounds. It was disturbing.
Life generally was disturbing. An elderly
woman in a bath-chair saw that it was so, or
guessed it rather than saw it. She was an adept at
guessing things. She had seen Marcus meet and
walk away with the girl with big brown eyes, which
held tragedy in their depths. She could see by the
cut of Marcus’s clothes, by his shoes, all she wanted
to know of his circumstances in life. She guessed
him to be a bachelor and defenceless, because
bored. This was not entirely astuteness on her
part; she had heard Shan’t call him “Uncle,” and
it is only a bachelor uncle who would take a small
niece away with him, knowing nothing of the dangers
of so doing, and the difficulties. No married
man would attempt to do what it takes at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
two women to do properly—judging by the babies
on the shore and their attendants.</p>

<p>So the next time Marcus passed the elderly
woman in her bath-chair, she smiled at him. Not
as the other woman had smiled, hoping to attract
him, but knowing she would. He was attracted.
He liked elderly women as many bachelors do.
They find in them a safe outlet.</p>

<p>“Come and talk to me,” said this one, and
Marcus felt delighted to do so. “What have you
done with your little girl?” she asked.</p>

<p>Marcus said he had left her on the sands—with—</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I know, the nice girl with dark eyes—tragic
eyes, tragic eyes set in a calm face. Nature
plays curious tricks, doesn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I suppose she does. She is my niece.”</p>

<p>“The girl with the tragic eyes—that accounts
for it, then.”</p>

<p>“No—no—the child.”</p>

<p>“A delightful child.”</p>

<p>That started Marcus—off he went. It was astonishing
how much he found to say about Shan’t.
From her getting up in the morning to her going
to bed at night: he told it all—and the woman in
the bath-chair listened with gentle amusement.
Here was a father utterly wasted. This man should
marry: but not the girl with tragic, happy, big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
brown eyes. She mustn’t marry a man who would
criticize her and be ashamed of her connections.
This man was not a big enough man to marry her.
He must marry one of his set; who knew what to
say and when to say it, and how to say it: who
would have things social at her finger-tips. The
woman in the bath-chair liked the girl with brown
eyes, but she saw at a glance what background
should be hers. She settled her in her home with a
devoted husband. They would furnish in suites.
The girl would have her embroidered tea-cosy:
that was certain and a table centre of Indian embroidery—it
might be worked in gold thread: it
might be worked in green beetles. She would
wear—? She would dress in the height of the
fashion. This was delightful. The elderly woman
loved making up stories about people. But it didn’t
amuse Marcus; he didn’t know what she was
smiling at.</p>

<p>“What amuses you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“So much—nearly everything! In fact everything
except the tragedies of life—and those often
might have been avoided if some one had laughed
at the right moment.”</p>

<p>“The difficulty is to know the right moment,”
said Marcus. “What amused you?”</p>

<p>She told him: described the home she had chosen
for the girl. Marcus said she was very unkind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
Why unkind? she wanted to know. She was praising
the girl, if only he could see it. That was why
he could never marry a girl like that: he could
never see how delightful, how wholesome, how
splendid she was.</p>

<p>“If you had a son—would you like him to
marry her?”</p>

<p>“No, because my son might, I am afraid, be
something like you. Too spoilt to be natural. Both
you and he would look for things that are superficial
and unnecessary—a certain easy manner—a
ready jargon. You are perfectly right to look for
it, for you have come to expect it. As I say, you
would criticize this girl—and criticism would
stunt her growth. She would be unnatural, and in
course of time she would be unhappy. But the
young man she should marry will admire her:
bring out the best in her: encourage her; and in
course of time what she must learn will be taught
her by her sons and daughters. The daughters
will criticize her and the sons will force her to be
different. By that time she will be ready to change—and
in the background there will always be her
husband to tell her, when they find themselves
alone, that he liked her best as she was, and things
as they used to be. And if she had not been so
happy young she would never have such fine boys
and girls, and it is her boys and girls—girls particularly—who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
are going to make England. Now
let us see the little niece—I am rather blind—I
cannot see her face at a distance.”</p>

<p>Marcus called “Shan’t” and Mrs. Sloane smiled.
This Marcus did not see. He was rearranging the
skirts of Shan’t: pulling up her socks; arranging
her hair, so that some of it at least showed under
her hat; then he patted her generally, as any
mother might have done.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the elderly woman.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Shan’t, beaming.</p>

<p>Marcus was delighted to see how quickly they
made friends. Every one took to Shan’t.</p>

<p>He turned and found the dark-eyed girl coming
towards him—shyly advancing. She was certainly
too self-conscious. “My mother says we should be
so pleased if you would come shrimping with us
this afternoon and come to supper afterwards.”
She had made the great advance; Marcus would
have retreated, but he had been caught unprepared;
he hesitated, seeking an excuse. The first
that presented itself to him was that his legs were
too pale, as Shan’t’s had been: the next that he
didn’t shrimp.</p>

<p>“But you must have supper somewhere?” she
suggested.</p>

<p>Marcus could not say that as a rule he did not
have it anywhere, so he said—“Oh, thank you—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“Then you <em>will</em>?”</p>

<p>While Marcus was talking to the girl the elderly
woman stooped forward—and drew Shan’t towards
her. “Shan’t, darling,” she said, “don’t tell
Uncle Marcus I know you. For a joke, let’s pretend.”</p>

<p>“Let’s!” said Shan’t, enchanted. She required
no more than a hint, and when Marcus came back,
deeply engaged to supper, he found the two talking—making
conversation.</p>

<p>“Have you many children?” asked Shan’t, sitting
down on an inverted tin bucket.</p>

<p>“No—I have no children.”</p>

<p>“That’s—a pity, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes—it’s a great pity.”</p>

<p>“No boys—not one? Perhaps you’ve forgotten—?
You might have one or two—perhaps in
the toy cupboard—”</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear—I hope your little dog is quite
well?”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much—but my little dog is
dead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear—I <em>am</em> surprised—they don’t generally—but
the gooseberries are very good this
year, at least I think they are.”</p>

<p>“Excellent,” said the elderly lady; “I have
never seen better.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“And the red-currants are rather good,” said
Shan’t.</p>

<p>“Excellent.”</p>

<p>“Do you paddle often?” asked Shan’t.</p>

<p>“No, I have just had influenza.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear—that’s rather a pity.”</p>

<p>“It is, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em>—what shall I say next?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t whisper,” said Marcus; “it isn’t
polite.”</p>

<p>“I think—I’ll just go—and look for—crabs,”
said Shan’t, getting pink.</p>

<p>“Do,” said the elderly woman. “A most intelligent
child,” she added, turning to Marcus, “but
why does she wear shoes and socks and a hat?”</p>

<p>“Ought she not?” asked Marcus anxiously.</p>

<p>“She would be happier without—but leave her
now. Tell me about her.”</p>

<p>“She’s a curious child in some ways—the way
she makes friends, surely, is unusual; and her conversation
with you—rather advanced for a child
of her age, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Most unusual.”</p>

<p>“It’s not dangerous, is it?”</p>

<p>“I see no possible danger in her talking to me.”</p>

<p>“No; I mean she isn’t too clever for her age, is
she?”</p>

<p>“She is so much with you—isn’t she?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Marcus smiled—“Oh, I didn’t mean that.”</p>

<p>That evening Mrs. Sloane wrote a letter and it
ran as follows:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Elsie</span>,—I have met the ogre. He’s
really rather an ingratiating ogre and the most
attentive of uncles. He is delightful with Shan’t.
He is taken for a widower with his little girl. One
dark-eyed siren has already tried to enchant him.
I have interfered. The girl is much too good for
him, and in other ways unsuitable. He couldn’t
make her happy and she certainly would make him
very unhappy. He would be in no danger at all if
he were not bored and the mother managing. I
don’t see, Elsie, why you should dislike him. He
doesn’t know that I know you. Amusing, isn’t it?
Shan’t and I are in the secret. She plays up splendidly—makes
conversation and asks me how
many children I have. She seems very happy and
quite at home. She is too heavily hatted and
stoutly shod, but I have interfered there, too. To
me the uncle seems wasted. He should marry. I
should make friends, if I were you.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>To which Elsie wrote back that she was perfectly
friendly towards Mr. Maitland. It was he who was
impossible. She certainly couldn’t make advances.
He had been very rude and very selfish about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
Diana. Diana, dear child, was very loyal to him
and never said anything against him. Shan’t, of
course, childlike, would be fond of any one who
indulged her.</p>

<p>The elderly woman lay back in her chair and
laughed when she read Elsie’s letter. Elsie was perfectly
friendly towards the poor uncle. What would
she be if she were unfriendly?</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Horrible!”</span> thought Marcus as he made his
way towards the house where lodged the girl
and her mother, and he supposed her brothers and
sisters. Supper? And shrimps for supper? The
shrimps he had been asked to shrimp for? Why
had Shan’t got him into this difficulty?</p>

<p>It was her fault. If she had been less get-at-able,
less ready with her all-embracing smile, he would
never have known the girl and her mother. If Sibyl
hadn’t married Eustace Carston this could never
have happened.</p>

<p>Arrived at the house Marcus found the door
wide open. He knocked on it with his stick and
viciously broke a blister in the paint which took
him back to the joys of boyhood. Out rushed a
small boy—exactly the kind of small boy he
should have expected. A boy covered with sand—his
hair full of it—his knees sandy—his stockings
held sand in every rib.</p>

<p>“Hullo! You have come, then? Mum said you
would funk it at the last moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Did she?” asked Marcus. Was here an excuse
he could seize—</p>

<p>“Come in—the teapot’s on the table.”</p>

<p>Marcus followed the sandy boy into a room that
seemed full to overflowing—of the girl’s relations.
They all had great big eyes, some brown, some
blue: all too big. Their cheeks were too pink—they
were all horribly healthy. It was just the sort
of family she would belong to. The girl detached
herself from a crowd gathered round what they
chose to call an aquarium, to make much of Marcus—to
put him at his ease. She wore a pink blouse
and was quite free from sand. Her cheeks were
flushed, but that might come from shrimping. She
was a little too pleased to see him, and a little too
grateful to him for coming. Perhaps she knew how
much he was suffering. She must know he wasn’t
accustomed to this kind of thing. He thought of
Diana. How would she look in the midst of this
family? Delightfully cool, he knew, and tremendously
amused. She would love to see him being
made a fuss of by the wrong kind of people.</p>

<p>The sandy boy, having given his sister her
chance, proceeded to take his and monopolized
Mr. Maitland.</p>

<p>Marcus thought in despair that the tea, if ever
possible at this hour, must by now be quite undrinkable.
The sandy boy had a crab in water to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
show Mr. Maitland, and a starfish imprisoned—it
had died—and there were jellyfish in a bucket—jellyfish
of all pets the least likely to move Marcus
to enthusiasm. He tried to be interested—was
beginning to like the small boy a little—when
the mother came and told Sandy to leave Mr.
Maitland alone.</p>

<p>“Why should Rose have him?” asked the sandy
boy, defiantly.</p>

<p>“Sandy, you scamp,” said his mother, “what
nonsense you talk!”</p>

<p>“It <em>isn’t</em>—you <em>said</em>—we were to leave Rosie
with Mr. Maitland—”</p>

<p>“Sandy, Sandy, where do you expect to go
to—?”</p>

<p>“<em>When?</em> Well—you said, we were to leave
him”—nodding in Marcus’s direction—“to
Rosie—it comes to the same thing.”</p>

<p>“Are you interested in old things, Mr. Maitland?”
asked Mrs. Madder.</p>

<p>Marcus said he was—in some old things.</p>

<p>“We are always on the lookout—this is a sweet
little print, isn’t it?” She held out a cheaply
framed, hand-coloured print for his inspection.</p>

<p>Marcus looked at it and asked where she had
got it.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s telling,” she answered playfully;
“the man said it was a bargain, though I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
think even he knew its true value. What do you
think I gave for it?”</p>

<p>Marcus said he had no idea. Mrs. Madder challenged
him to guess, but did not wait to hear
whether he made a good guess or not. He must see
the quaintest little bit of china she had bought!
Was he jealous? That it was quaint Marcus could
say with perfect truth—with less truth that he
was very jealous.</p>

<p>“It’s such fun collecting, isn’t it?” she asked
impetuously. She was terribly impetuous and inclined
to be playful.</p>

<p>He admitted it was—great—fun.</p>

<p>“And it doesn’t cost much, if you know!”</p>

<p>Marcus said no doubt she was right, it was a
question of knowledge, and he sat with the china
woolly lamb in his hands, with his thoughts on
that horrible teapot.</p>

<p>“Isn’t supper ready?” asked some one.</p>

<p>“Ages ago,” said the sandy boy; “I simply
yelled that the teapot was on the table.”</p>

<p>“You should have said it louder,” suggested
another.</p>

<p>Marcus was put next to Rosie; Mrs. Madder
explaining that there was no need for ceremony;
besides, she was so busy with the teapot she
wouldn’t be able to amuse Mr. Maitland:—and
Auntie was deaf, so she liked to have her next her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
so that she could repeat the jokes to her. “Here,
Auntie! Next to me; I will tell you if Mr. Maitland
says anything amusing.”</p>

<p>On the other side of Marcus sat a man who,
gathering that Mr. Maitland was interested in old
things, told him of all the cheap places he knew in
London—and after having done that, told him
most of the contents of a shilling hand-book on
“How to collect anything, and everything.” It was
most interesting—only a shilling! He would lend
it to Mr. Maitland.</p>

<p>Mr. Maitland said he had hardly time to collect
everything. The man smiled and said it did not
mean “everything” literally, naturally, and he
was hurt and refused to talk any more. Gratefully
Marcus turned to the quiet Rose at his other side
who had nothing to teach him, but a generous
sympathy to offer any one. She was ready to be
sorry about anything—sorry that he wouldn’t
have any more tea—no more lobster salad? Well,
blanc-mange, then? Not with strawberry jam?
Well—sardines? Shrimps, then? Shrimps, he
<em>must</em>, because they were the shrimps he ought to
have caught.</p>

<p>No, nothing, Marcus assured her. He had dined—suppered—he
had had quite enough.</p>

<p>“We make cocoa when we come in,” said Rose,
beaming at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>Here at least was certain comfort and something
to look forward to.</p>

<p>“Come in from where?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, we just go out and wander about—it’s
so delicious—you will—won’t you? It’s too hot
to stay indoors, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Much too hot.”</p>

<p>“Before you go out, Rosie,” said her mother,
“just play Mr. Maitland that dear little Berceuse—Tum-ti
tum-ti tum—you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, mother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Marcus.</p>

<p>“Don’t you like music?” she asked, surprised,
men so often did.</p>

<p>“I have never—”</p>

<p>“Well you should hear Rosie. I’m sure you
would like it—but I’m afraid the piano hasn’t
been tuned—”</p>

<p>“Please don’t, mother!”</p>

<p>“After all we have paid for you, Rosie! Rosie!”</p>

<p>“Some other time,” pleaded Marcus; “it’s so
hot indoors.”</p>

<p>“Do you find it hot? Sandy, let Mr. Maitland
sit next the door; there, do move, Mr. Maitland!
Auntie, make room for Mr. Maitland and Rosie.”
She shook her head, “She can’t hear. Well, shall
we go out, then?”</p>

<p>Marcus stepped out into the fresh, cool air with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
a sigh of deepest thankfulness. Even the girl who
trod the red-bricked path beside him he could
forgive for daring to fall in love with him. The
mother for trying to catch him he should never
forgive; but there was something attractive about
Rosie. “Shall we sit here?” she asked when they
reached the sands. He would rather she had left
it to him to choose the place; but in full view of
the whole watering-place and that a favourite one,
there should be no immediate danger. Under the
shelter of a rock they sat. Yes—she was attractive—he
could see no reason why she should marry as
the old lady in the bath-chair had imagined she
should. Surely there must be something between
Marcus Maitland and that other man? Rose knew
how to be quiet, which was a great thing in woman.—She
stuck out her feet. Her shoes? Bad shape;
and her stockings? They weren’t quite right. He
didn’t see what was wrong exactly—unless it was
that the other sides of the seams showed through—but
still she was very attractive: her simplicity
was engaging. Well-shaped shoes were after all a
matter—a question of money.</p>

<p>“It’s funny you should be Mr. Maitland, isn’t
it?” she said, digging her heels into the soft sand and
looking up at him under her long, dark eyelashes.</p>

<p>“It would be far funnier if I was not—funnier
to me, at all events.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, of course: you are so amusing, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Am I? I don’t think so.” He was open to conviction.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are—I’m serious—don’t you think
you are?”</p>

<p>“Amusing?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I never thought so.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are—and I’m sure you are—kind
too!”</p>

<p>“Are you, why?” Unconsciously, perhaps, Marcus
put on the kindest face in the world—an
absurd face it was, but Rose was looking the other
way.</p>

<p>“You look it,” she said softly.</p>

<p>Marcus said she had said he looked so many
things, amongst them a widower.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad you are not that.” The tragic
eyes were turned upon him—they were positively
wells of deep thankfulness.</p>

<p>“Why?” He was terrified—yet, fascinated, he
must know why.</p>

<p>She said she would have hated him to be unhappy.</p>

<p>“But,”—he was getting very uncomfortable:
he wished Shan’t would come and bury him in the
sand, as she was wont to do—deep, deep, deep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
“But,” he went on desperately, “I might not have
been unhappy—”</p>

<p>“Not if your wife had died? I should have hated
that—I mean I should hate you to be—shallow.
I know you would have been heart-broken: I
should wish you to be.” That settled it, once and
for all—</p>

<p>“Why?” Marcus felt he was now paddling in
pathos. He saw himself a widower walking to
church with a child on either side: their hands in
his.</p>

<p>“Because I want you to think rather wonderfully
of marriage—and married life.”</p>

<p>Marcus said hastily that he could not think of
them at all.</p>

<p>“Why—you must—for my sake. You will—if
I ask you to.”</p>

<p>“Because there are reasons” (there were none,
of course) “I can never marry.”</p>

<p>“I—am—so sorry—” There was a terrific
silence—an impossible silence.</p>

<p>She broke it gently—broke it as softly as the
waves broke upon the sands. “But you won’t
mind if I do?”</p>

<p>“My dear child, of course not—do you want
to?” This was a marvellous way out.</p>

<p>She said, Yes, but she could not do it without
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>He asked what he had to do with it, and she
said, “More than you know,” which he was willing
enough to admit!—So far as he could see he had
nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>“Much more than you know,” she repeated.</p>

<p>She drew up her feet. They were very pretty
slim feet, he discovered. He liked the shoes even,
except that they were white. He didn’t really like
white shoes. She clasped her hands round her
knees. He liked her hands, particularly liked them.
They were long and delightfully brown. He didn’t
mind brown hands—not a bit—at the seaside.</p>

<p>“Whom do you want to marry?” he asked, feeling
a sudden rush of tenderness towards this dark-eyed
girl, and a slight resentment towards the man
she would marry. This girl had found him both
sympathetic and amusing. If Diana thought him
amusing she would never tell him so.</p>

<p>“That’s the curious part of the whole thing—I
heard from some one this morning.”</p>

<p>“The some one?” said Marcus, with marvellous
intuition. He really was sympathetic, he felt the
glow of it himself.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he said you were here—”</p>

<p>“Why did he say that?” What business had any
one to say Marcus Maitland was anywhere—even
if he were? He hated his movements discussed.</p>

<p>“Because you are, I suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course. But how does he know?”</p>

<p>“He’s in your office—isn’t it extraordinary?”</p>

<p>“Very—and what is he in my office? And my
office, by the way, is so little mine. I have left the
business—”</p>

<p>“Yes—I know! It’s rather a pity, from our
point of view.”</p>

<p>“It was hardly worth the trouble of getting to
know me?” suggested Marcus.</p>

<p>“No—I don’t mean that—but although he
doesn’t see you now, he knew you in America—he
was sent over there for a year or two—”</p>

<p>“What position does he hold?”</p>

<p>“He’s getting on very well—for his age wonderfully
well—but I thought if you could just
tell me what his prospects are—I might tell my
mother—and she would give her consent, I am
sure—if I could just say he was getting on wonderfully
well—and—”</p>

<p>“What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Flueyn—pronounced Flynn—he said you
never got it right.”</p>

<p>“Does he? I’m sorry. Flueyn? Why, he’s a most
excellent fellow. I remember him.”</p>

<p>“Will—he—get on?”</p>

<p>“Yes—of course—bound to—”</p>

<p>“How—much a year will he get on?”</p>

<p>Marcus thought for a moment—Flueyn—excellent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
chap—fine big fellow—he had rather a
terrible laugh: too boisterous in private life, he
should say. But he didn’t know him in private life—no
question of knowing him—very good worker—very
keen—it was quite possible he would get
on. But why did this girl want to marry him?</p>

<p>“How—much—?” The tragic eyes were
turned upon him; they were pleading eyes, dangerous
eyes—the red lips trembled a little—dangerous
too—very. How much was going to
make such a tremendous difference—the hands
tensely clasped said that: the eyes clouded expressed
that—the parted lips meant that.</p>

<p>“Of course—I would do anything within my
power—but I am not in a—”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that.”</p>

<p>“Don’t cry—it will be all right—tell your
mother it will be all right—don’t thank me.”</p>

<p>“How <em>can</em> I thank you?”</p>

<p>“By not thanking me—Flueyn’s an excellent
chap—no, I won’t come and have cocoa, thank
you. I never drink it at night. You will be all
right? Then you will forgive me if I go home; I
have letters to write. I won’t forget, only don’t
build on it—because—”</p>

<p>“I have built—it’s finished—all but the
roof.”</p>

<p>Marcus looked at her—there were tears in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
eyes. “Please don’t look so—happy,” he said;
“it frightens me.”</p>

<p>On his way back to the hotel, he called in to see
Mrs. Sloane. She was delighted to see him and to
hear his news.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it—begin at the very beginning.
Tell me first about the young man.”</p>

<p>“He’s very big and I should say wonderfully
healthy: has lots of hair—fair! It stands on end
at the slightest provocation. He laughs, I should
imagine, tremendously. Out of office hours he
would be boisterous, I am sure of that—but none
of her family will mind—‘Auntie’ wouldn’t hear
him if he wasn’t. He plays games, I believe—I
don’t know what else to tell you. You see I didn’t
know him—I didn’t even know how to pronounce
his name.”</p>

<p>“But you ought to have known him. He sounds
so eminently desirable.”</p>

<p>“For her—yes, but he would jar upon you a
thousand times a day.”</p>

<p>“That would be my fault—it’s a bad thing for
a woman when she grows too fragile, too exotic, to
stand a boisterous laugh. You are very gentle, my
friend, to an old woman.... I told Shan’t I felt
very old to-day, and she said, so kindly: ‘You’re
not so old as Moses would have been if he had
lived.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>She put out her hand and Marcus took it and
held it as delicately and as carefully as he would
have held a vase of the Ming period.</p>

<p>“The Flueyns must be happy,” she said. “You
will see that they are.”</p>

<p>“I have very little influence—really.”</p>

<p>“Is that quite true?”</p>

<p>“Not quite.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane said that was rather a comfort to
her because she had a confession to make. She had
not been quite—well, truthful herself. Marcus
was a little alarmed. He could not imagine an
elderly woman in a bath-chair departing in any
way from the path of goodness and righteousness.
He asked what she had to confess and asked it so
charmingly that she vowed he had missed his vocation
in life. “You would forgive so nicely,” she
explained.</p>

<p>“Hardly as nicely as you would tell a—lie,” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“A lie is perhaps a little too strong—no, I suppose
it’s not—I led you to believe I did not know
Shan’t, whereas I know her very well: and of course
I know Elsie. I live in Bestways, and I have known
her for a long time, and the longer I know her the
better I love her. Now, am I forgiven?”</p>

<p>“The best thing I have heard of her is that you
are her friend,” said Marcus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>“How nice of you—to tell an untruth so charmingly!
But tell me why you dislike each other so
much? It was in order to find out if Elsie was justified
in her ridiculous attitude towards you that I
did not tell you who I was.”</p>

<p>“Does she really dislike me?” asked Marcus.
“Why should she? I have never done anything to
her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane asked him if he hadn’t made the
children rather fond of him.</p>

<p>“But surely she couldn’t mind that?”</p>

<p>“Why do you dislike her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t; but she is always trying to keep the
children away from me.”</p>

<p>“I see very little difference between you,” said
Mrs. Sloane; and after what she had said about
Elsie, Marcus was obliged to say he was glad of
that.</p>

<p>When Marcus reached the hotel he was met by
the hall porter, who astonished him by saying:
“I’m a family man myself, sir, you will excuse me—but
will you go upstairs at once? I was told to
say—<em>directly</em> you came in.”</p>

<p>Marcus went upstairs. Over the banisters at
each landing hung an anxious housemaid. Each
housemaid expressed her relief at seeing him, each
begged him to hurry. Each assured him the lift
was working. He had been in too great a hurry to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
remember the lift. When he got near his room a
voice broke upon his ear—a long wail—the cry
of one in great distress; the wail spoke loudly of
Irish blood in the veins of her who wailed. It was
the voice of his niece. Infuriated old women
glanced at him through half-opened doors. “What
had he been doing gallivanting about at night?”
they seemed to say and no doubt they would have
liked to add: “If he had left the mother he might
at least stay with the child.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t,” he called, “I’m coming.” He passed
lady’s-maids gathered together, and strode into
Shan’t’s room. Then and there he decided that
he had never seen a child cry—never imagined a
child could cry—not the child of any one belonging
to him—as this child cried. It was impossible
that anything could cry so terribly. Tears poured
down her face: her eyes were screwed up. It was
a horrible exhibition showing a deplorable lack of
self-restraint.</p>

<p>“Shan’t, stop!” He sat down beside her, he
shook her gently—nothing made any difference.
“I’m here, your Uncle Marcus is here—”</p>

<p>This was why there were people in the world
who didn’t love children. They had seen them
like this.</p>

<p>“I don’t want him—I want my darlin’—Aunt
Elsie—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>“No, Shan’t, you don’t. You are at the seaside
with your darling uncle.”</p>

<p>“I’m—not—I won’t be at the seaside. I want
my darlin’ Aunt Elsie.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t—listen!” He tried to take her in his
arms. She became rigid, unbendable—unbreakable—“Shan’t—!”</p>

<p>“I—want—my—darlin’ Aunt—Elsie.”</p>

<p>The management sent up to say, Would the
young lady be quiet? There was an elderly gentleman
above her—and an old lady below her—who
could get no sleep.</p>

<p>“Shan’t—be quiet!”</p>

<p>“Nasty Uncle Marcus!”</p>

<p>“Shan’t—listen—”</p>

<p>But she refused to listen—she wriggled away
under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Shan’t?”</p>

<p>She emerged from under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>“I want my darlin’ Aunt Elsie.”</p>

<p>“But you can’t have her—she’s miles away.
Would you like the kind lady who played with you
on the sands?”</p>

<p>“She’s dead!” cried Shan’t—wailing afresh.</p>

<p>“No—she’s not. Look here, will you be good
if I fetch her?”</p>

<p>“Will she bring my darlin’ crab—what was on
the sands—?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Yes—yes—”</p>

<p>“W—ill—you fet-ch—her?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Marcus was off downstairs, three steps at a time—scattering
housemaids as he went, out on to the
sea-front, and finally reached the Madders’ door
just as the cocoa was pronounced ready. “Oh,
you’re just in time!” they all cried, as he came into
the room. “Rose, fetch another cup and a spoon;
no, you must share spoons.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Rose, who was quick to see
that something was wrong.</p>

<p>“It’s Shan’t, she won’t go to sleep—she does
nothing but cry—will you come—and bring a
crab?”</p>

<p>To which unusual request Rose made no objection.
“Sandy,” she cried, “lend me a crab!”</p>

<p>“All right—there’s one under the sofa. Move,
will you, Auntie, there’s a crab—hold hard—it’s
in a bucket—it won’t bite.”</p>

<p>Marcus apologized to the assembled family,
begged them to forgive him, didn’t wait to be
assured of their ready forgiveness, but was off in
the wake of Rose. As he had run down the pavement
in London after Diana, so he now ran down
the red-brick path after Rose. She ran less lightly,
perhaps, than Diana had run, but then she was
less lightly dressed. She ran just as fast—horribly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
fast. His life had become a restless and strenuous
one. Arrived at the hotel he and Rose went up in
the lift. He noticed the water from the pail streaming
down the front of her skirt; he never thought
of the poor crab as he tried to dry it. She begged
him not to; he mustn’t wet his handkerchief. He
said it was already wet with the tears of Shan’t—soaked!</p>

<p>They found Shan’t sitting up in bed. The storm
was passing; the waves of her sobs were breaking—the
moaning of the outgoing tide was still to be
heard. Rose was on her knees beside the bed, and
in one moment her arms were round the child.
Marcus turned away; he could not have said why,
except that somehow or other he felt as if it were
Flueyn’s right before any other man’s to see Rose
as she looked now—altogether adorable like this—he
had never seen her so desirable.</p>

<p>He felt he ought not to be listening to the
crooning of that voice, even to the absurd things
she was saying—they were women’s secrets he
was overhearing; he was a listener on the threshold
of a door he had deliberately closed in his
life.</p>

<p>After the storm there came peace. Shan’t was
whispering: every now and then came the backwash
of a sob—but peace followed it. He seemed
to see the golden reflection of the setting sun on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
the wet sands. Shan’t was putting her fingers in
and out of the button-holes in the girl’s knitted
coat and was smiling up into her face. Rose was
wiping away the tears from the child’s face. Shan’t
was shyly promising to be good—never to cry
any more? She nodded. Rose persuaded her to lie
down. Shan’t insisted that she must say good-night
to the crab. This was accomplished—poor
crab! She must then pray for the crab and for all
little crabs. This was done. By degrees she fell
asleep, and until Rose was quite certain that nothing
would awaken her she knelt beside her. Marcus
watched her for a moment, then turned away
and walked to the window. He felt lonely. There
was silence except for the sound of the waves breaking
on the shore beneath the window, very softly.
The world, with Shan’t, had fallen gently to sleep
and the waves sang a lullaby.</p>

<p>“She’s all right,” whispered Rose; “there will
be some one near if she wakes?”</p>

<p>Marcus nodded.</p>

<p>“Then I shall go home—give me that poor
crab.”</p>

<p>Marcus was afraid it was dead. Rose said all
Sandy’s pets died young. They walked back to the
lodgings together, in silence.</p>

<p>At the door he stopped. “I can’t thank you,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“There’s nothing to thank me for—I love
children.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing I want to say—it will be
all right with Flueyn.”</p>

<p>He asked her not to thank him, he said there
was nothing to thank him for. She laughed, then
added shyly, “How little you know!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Shan’t</span> had gone back to her aunt. Diana was
with her aunt and Marcus was alone. He felt
the position to be an absurd one. Why should he
be separated from two nieces because an aunt, on
the other side, chose to behave in a jealous and
absurd manner? It was quite possible, if he could
see the aunt, that she might in talking tell him,
quite unconsciously, if Diana were in love or not?
It was ridiculous he shouldn’t know, if he wished
to know—and if she knew. With all her faults
the aunt, no doubt, was fond of the children. Why
shouldn’t he go down and see her? So he got a
Bradshaw and looked up trains—he would have
gone by car, but he had told Diana that Tooke
wasn’t—what had he said?—strong enough to
do the distance? He forgot what he had said, he
had been vexed at the time—and he found it was
possible to get to the aunt by twelve o’clock on
any morning, so why not to-morrow? He should
write to say he was coming—no, he would take
her by surprise; see her as she really was.</p>

<p>When a woman deliberately sets out to weed on
a summer’s day she will know, if she has any imagination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
that her face will be likely to redden under
the exertion, be it wonted or unwonted; further,
that she will not be looking her best if her niece’s
uncle should chance to call upon her. Elsie Carston’s
imagination might have gone so far as to
expect a red face under given circumstances, but
never a visit, under any, from Diana’s disagreeable
uncle. Yet this thing happened. Her small parlour-maid
came to tell her so. She whispered it,
hoarse from suppressed excitement. She vowed he
was standing looking “amazed-like” at the “blue
vawse.”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Elsie, “he must wait till my
face is less red”—never dreaming that Rebecca
would be so silly; but Rebecca was. She went
back to the drawing-room and she said, “Miss
Carston is so red in the face, sir, will you please to
wait?”</p>

<p>And Marcus, if not pleased, waited. He had kept
people waiting himself, and never for a more excellent
reason. He hated women with red faces.
That was one of Diana’s greatest charms—the
unvarying beauty of her complexion. Ah—Diana?
Where was she—and Shan’t, too? Why didn’t
the tiresome aunt come? A bumptious woman is
not complete unless she has a red face—a danger
signal; so she might just as well come as she was,
as she always was, and would always be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>The moments crept on—still he waited. He
paced up and down the room until he was giddy,
and he felt for the bears in the Zoo as he had never
felt before. He realized the daily round of their
discomfort now. This, then, was where Diana lived:
with this furniture? Well, it wasn’t bad—of its
kind. It was rough, of course. The grandfather’s
clock, that ticked so insistently, must have stood
in a deaf cottager’s kitchen. The gate-legged table
had been undoubtedly cursed by many a lusty
farmer and his sons for the multitude and distribution
of its legs.</p>

<p>The furniture was well kept. There was that to
the aunt’s credit, or to her servants’. He wondered
if she had any more like the absurd creature who
had conveyed, with the utmost solemnity, that
ridiculous message. There couldn’t be such another
in the world.</p>

<p>Back to the blue vase. It seemed familiar. Ridiculous
place to keep it—on a bracket—meaningless.
The Staffordshire china? Rubbish. How easily
women were taken in! So long as the piece was an
imbecile lamb or an impossible cottage, she was
satisfied. No doubt she had bought the lamb because
it was a “duck,” and the cottage because it
was a “lamb.” He could hear her. She had been
wise to keep to white walls. If she had attempted
colour she must have gone wrong. He liked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
chintz. It was in keeping. Red flowers on a highly
glazed surface.</p>

<p>Why didn’t she come? It was the worst form of
discourtesy to keep any one waiting. Where had
she got the mezzotints? Or rather how? Left to her
by a relative who had bought them cheap years
ago, anticipating their value. She would tell him
so—tiresome! He didn’t care how she had got
them. They were nice enough, though. First state,
eh? Open letters? He walked from one to the other.
Cut edges? Here was one with the margin nibbled
by a mouse—just what he should have expected
to happen to the print belonging to a red-faced
woman. Needlework pictures? Quite amusing!
Country-house sale, he suspected: and a Downman?
People do get these things somehow or other.
She had withstood the lure of the hand-coloured
print. Books? What did the woman read? He was
on all fours trying to discover when the door opened
and to his intense astonishment he heard a woman’s
voice say, “Lie down, Marcus!” He rose instead—anything
rather than obey—and found himself
face to face with Aunt Elsie. What had been the
use of waiting? Her face was still red.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry,” she said, “I forgot; do forgive
me—Marcus is my dog.”</p>

<p>Grey eyes! They looked at him, and he remembered
that years ago they had distinctly said:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
“Beaten!” They challenged him now—“Goth!”
it was coming back to him; “Vandal!—nice, grey-eyed
woman—ignorant woman!” he repeated to
himself. “Your gloves,” he said involuntarily.</p>

<p>“You would think I never wore them,” she said,
holding out her sunburnt, shapely hands for his
inspection, “but I do.”</p>

<p>“You wore them then—and the wrong kind.
That’s what I so disliked about you. You took that
vase in gloved hands—dogskin-gloved hands—”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was you, was it?” said Elsie. “You
looked so angry and I couldn’t explain—I knew
it wasn’t a good vase—yes, I did—”</p>

<p>“Then why—”</p>

<p>“Forgive me one moment, there’s Dinah—”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Marcus, “delightful—” thinking
she had said Diana.</p>

<p>“No, Dinah—my dog—she’s got Marcus’s
ball, she knows she mustn’t—please wait—if
Peggy comes in, send her to her dinner, will
you?”</p>

<p>“How? What shall I do?”</p>

<p>“Just say, ‘Marky’s got Peggy’s dinner’—and
she’ll fly!”</p>

<p>Off went Aunt Elsie, leaving Marcus to deal with
Peggy—another dog, he supposed. “Marky’s got
Peggy’s dinner!” He was hanged if he would say it.
A moment later the door opened and Rebecca<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
looked in: “You haven’t got Peggy, have you,
sir?”</p>

<p>Marcus said he had not.</p>

<p>“She’s so excited at your coming, sir, she was
tearing round the lawn like mad, just now—here
she is!” Peggy tore into the room; tore round it
two or three times, slipping, skidding on rugs, as
she went. “Call her!” said Marcus.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, sir, not till she’s got accustomed
to the excitement of you—”</p>

<p>“Tell her ‘Marky has got her lunch,’ or dinner;
whatever meal you like to call it.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be any use, sir, not when she’s
wild over your coming like she is now.”</p>

<p>When Elsie came back, she had the grace to
apologize, but it was evident she had no idea how
badly she had behaved, or how impossible the dogs
had been. Marcus thought that dogs must, at least,
be obedient. Elsie said she was really very sorry,
and as she spoke she marshalled the dogs and sent
them off to their various dinners: then she came
back, looked at him, and said he was exactly what
she had always known he was.</p>

<p>“What is that?” he asked: it was rash of him to
ask.</p>

<p>“Frightfully obstinate, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“And what else?”</p>

<p>“Heaps of things—but about this vase—an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
old lady I was very fond of sent me up to buy that
vase for her—<em>if</em> it had a mark upon it that she
had made as a girl—a scratch. If it had not, I was
not to buy it.”</p>

<p>Marcus said he was bewildered, he did not
understand.</p>

<p>“You will if you listen,” said Elsie. “Her father
had a collection of Chinese porcelain and he sold
it. One piece, she told him, had been given to her,
when she was a girl, by a young man with whom
she was in love. Her father disputed her claim,
and the vase was sold with the rest of the collection.
She was middle-aged then. When she heard
the collection was to be sold again—it was forty
years since her father had parted with it, and she
had grown to be a very old woman—she wanted
to buy back that one piece.”</p>

<p>“Feminine persistence,” said Marcus.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like to call it that—I suppose a
man may call a woman’s faithfulness by any name
he likes.”</p>

<p>“Did you find the mark?” asked Marcus meekly;
he was always cowed by feminine firmness.</p>

<p>Elsie looked at him, and a doubt entered his
mind. He asked if he might look at the vase—hold
it in his hand?</p>

<p>She handed it to him. He looked at it, then at her.
“You were to buy it, if there was a scratch upon it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>Elsie nodded. He handed her back the vase.</p>

<p>“But—she—died happy,” Elsie said, perhaps
pleading extenuating circumstances.</p>

<p>There was a silence while she replaced the vase
on the bracket.</p>

<p>“You gave too much for it,” said Marcus, refusing
to be beaten, or to be made to say wrong
was right—or to be touched by the thought of the
foolish old lady who had been taken in—so kindly.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked Elsie. “What, after
all, was too much to pay for a thing she wanted,
that would make her happy? She could afford to
pay. Anyhow, she left the vase to me and I put it
there.” She nodded to the bracket on the wall.</p>

<p>“A very bad place for it.”</p>

<p>“I like it there,” said Elsie, and Marcus knew
he had been right; pig-headed and obstinate was
Diana’s aunt.</p>

<p>“Where is Diana?” he asked.</p>

<p>“She’s reading aloud Mr. Watkins’s poems.”</p>

<p>“To whom?”</p>

<p>“To Mr. Watkins—she says he reads them in
a family-prayer sort of a voice that lends them a
fictitious value. She wants him to hear what they
sound like read by an ordinary person.”</p>

<p>Of course, Marcus at once said Diana was not an
ordinary person, and Elsie could only answer that
she read poetry like a very ordinary person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>“This man is in love with her, I suppose?”
asked Marcus gloomily.</p>

<p>“If she has read him his ‘Ode to Japonica,’ I
should say not.”</p>

<p>“He was in love with her, then?” persisted the
enquiring uncle.</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Why of course?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t every man in love with her?”</p>

<p>“And she—is she in love with any man?”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is the question,” said Elsie. The relations
between them, which had become surprisingly
easier, were again strained. She was the aunt
on the one side—he the uncle on the other. Rebecca
announced luncheon.</p>

<p>“I suppose we must eat,” said Marcus.</p>

<p>Elsie didn’t suppose anything about it; as a
matter of fact there was no necessity, but she led
the way to the dining-room, and there at the table
sat Diana.</p>

<p>“Dears!” she exclaimed, when she saw her uncle
and aunt; “getting so heated talking about me—how
do you like each other now you meet? Have
I exaggerated the charm of either of you? You
both think so? Well, darlings, sit down. No, Elsie,
you must do the honours and I’ll do the laughing
and the crying, if you like—but there must be
no more fighting. Look at your faces.” And she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
handed to each one a spoon. Elsie passed hers on
to Marcus. He laid them both down beside his
plate.</p>

<p>“Is my face red too?” he asked, turning to
Diana.</p>

<p>“Is that quite how you meant to put it?”
she asked; and he was obliged to answer, “Not
quite.”</p>

<p>Shan’t was out; she had gone to spend the day
with some children in the neighbourhood and she
wouldn’t be back till after tea. After tea seemed
a long way off to Marcus. Could he make Aunt
Elsie and her garden and her ridiculous farm last
till then? Diana was too distressed; she was engaged
to play golf with Mr. Pease.</p>

<p>“Don’t bother about me,” said Marcus stiffly.</p>

<p>Diana had no intention of bothering about him.
He had come to see Elsie, not her. It was so important
they should make friends. If she stayed
with them, they would both try, each one, to talk
to her more than the other.</p>

<p>“And when are you coming back to me, Diana?”
asked Marcus.</p>

<p>Diana looked from Marcus to Elsie and from
Elsie to Marcus.</p>

<p>“You are such unselfish darlings, both of you,”
she answered. “You must decide between you.”</p>

<p>Here was Elsie’s opportunity. “I think, perhaps,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Diana,” she said, “you ought to go to your uncle—your
mother left you with him.” And Elsie
knew that, in the eyes of Diana, she must stand
on the heights above Marcus—that Marcus must
look up to her.</p>

<p>But Marcus despised her. He knew she had done
it to impress Diana, and didn’t mean it.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t ask you to come back to London at
this time of year,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“You are both darlings,” said Diana, and she
went and left them.</p>

<p>And Elsie talked calmly of the joys of the country—mentioning
incidentally the heat of London
pavements, and Marcus said nothing, but he
thought the more. Elsie now looked quite cool: her
complexion was fair, and that, in conjunction with
her grey eyes, made her look younger than she
ought to have looked, or than he had expected her
to look.</p>

<p>He spun out his visit till tea-time, and after tea
Elsie volunteered to walk to the station with him.
“We may meet Shan’t,” she said.</p>

<p>They walked and they met Shan’t. She was
being escorted home by a family of boys and girls,
and was among those who filled a pony-cart to
overflowing. She was rioting; no other word described
the joy that possessed her. She was playing
mad bulls with a boy a little smaller than herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
Elsie called her to stop: besought her to speak to
her Uncle Marcus—but she couldn’t listen—she
was laughing—how she laughed! Marcus had a
train to catch—and the pony-cart passed on,
Shan’t still fighting the small boy—and laughing—so
happy and Uncle Marcus was so neglected.</p>

<p>“She didn’t realize it was you,” said Aunt Elsie.
“Children so soon forget.”</p>

<p>She might have spared him that thrust which he
had not the strength to parry. She might have
known that no child who is playing mad bulls
with a little boy, sufficiently mad, will stop to look
at an elderly uncle—or to listen to an—<em>elderly</em>
aunt.</p>

<p>In the train Marcus comforted himself by picturing
a scene in which he and Shan’t made it up.
He said, “Why didn’t you stop and speak to your
Uncle Marcus?”</p>

<p>And Shan’t said, “Well, you see, darlin’,”—her
fingers popped in and out of the button-holes of his
coat,—“I was so busy—I really didn’t—quite
properly see it was you.”</p>

<p>“But you were glad to see me—what you did
see of me?”</p>

<p>“Of course—I was—didn’t you <em>think</em> I was?”</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus hadn’t been sure.</p>

<p>“Let’s play at somethin’,” suggested Shan’t.</p>

<p>He felt comforted—a little. Two arms were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
round his neck, and he felt as nearly comforted as
it is possible to feel when the comforting arms are
not real arms and the child is not a real child, and
nothing is real but the hurt the <em>real</em> child inflicted.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is a small book, written by one of the
greatest masters of fiction. No romance stirs
the blood, excites the imagination of weary men,
as this book does. Lever, Dumas, Hugo are pigmies
compared to this giant among story-tellers.</p>

<p>It is a small book—no matter its colour—its
pages number some hundreds, and they can be
read, re-read, and read yet again. On every page is
the same story differently, and delightfully told. It
never palls. A wise woman is she who, seeing her
husband tired and perhaps bored, slips into his
hands this volume of immortal prose. If he be a
sportsman, his chair comfortable, and the fire
brightly burning, all his worries will vanish like
“smoke” on the hillside, and for the space of some
hours he will be at peace, tramping once again the
moors, fishing the rivers, the lochs, and climbing
the hills he loves. Marcus, lonely and deserted,
opened the book and read:</p>

<p>Marcus leant forward and re-filled his pipe—the
shadow of a great peace in his eyes—a smile
playing at the corners of his mouth. He had no

<p>“Not much,” murmured Marcus.</p>

<p>£250.</p>

<p>£200.</p>

<p>£270.</p>

<p>£300:—each in its small way buying for August
and September perfect happiness, and Marcus
knew what that perfect happiness might be. Agents
say much, sometimes more than they need, but do
they ever say anything of six o’clock in the morning,
on the moor, when the spiders’ webs, set with
diamonds, are slung from one tuft of heather to
another, making a wealth of jewels of untold value?
Do they ever describe the joy of walking home
knee-deep in scented purple heather right into the
setting sun, after a day on the hill? Do they ever
describe a fine day on the West Coast, as the West
Coast alone knows it? A fine day in Skye? No day,
for pure glory of fineness, can compare with it.
(And it might always be fine in Skye if people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
really believed in fairies.) Skye paints her foreground
as no other foreground is painted, so rich
in colour, so deep—so varied. No skies can vie
with hers in blueness, when they are blue. No distance
is so enchanting in its softness. No breeze so
caressing in its gentleness. No hills can compare
with the Cuchullins in their splendid ruggedness,
and the sun never sets in Scotland, leaving behind
him more glorious promises of his coming again than
he does in Skye. Do agents count these things?
They must—and that is why—if the grouse fail,
the deer fade away, and the fish sulk—the man
who truly loves his Scotland will always pay his
rent without murmuring, for those glorious two
months: and the day he gets back to London, if he
be a proper man, he will sit himself down in his
chair, his hand will reach out to the table at his
elbow, and he will take from the table a book that
his wife, if she be a wise wife, has placed there, and
he will open it at any page and read—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>£500—beau-ti-ful lodge, 40 miles from station—Contains—etc.—bag
should include—250 brace grouse, good woodcock
and snipe—wild fowl—in the winter—Exclusive
right—</p>
</div>

<p>This is the book Marcus read on his return to
London after sending Shan’t back to the aunt of
his detestation. It is a work of fiction that should
be in all circulating libraries, yet it is in none. During<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
the reading it came upon him—the inspiration—to
offer as a counter-attraction to Bestways—Scotland!</p>

<p>Could Diana resist a moor in Scotland? To shoot
over which she might ask any one she liked. What
would Aunt Elsie do against a force so overwhelming
as this? It was late in the season to get a place,
but sometimes late in the day even a good place is
to be had. Sometimes the best places might be
picked up at the last moment.</p>

<p>The next day Marcus lunched at his club, having
interviewed agents both hopeful and depressing.
At the club he met a friend plunged in the depths
of melancholy. So deeply immersed was he that
Marcus rose buoyant on the crest of a wave of
exultation. The friend’s wife was ill. Marcus, sobered,
expressed sympathy: the man, to a certain
extent, had brought it on himself by having a wife,
but still Marcus was sorry she was ill. Added to
that the man had taken a place in Scotland to
which he could not go in consequence of his wife’s
illness and the agents said it was too late to sub-let
it. Here Marcus was really sympathetic. What sort
of a place was it?—and out it all came—the
same grand old story. The blood that had run
through the veins of Marcus now coursed and by
the end of luncheon the moor was practically his—he
had walked it. Its geographical position was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
scored on the tablecloth: its marches defined by
spoons and forks. So much was the place his that
he felt justified in telegraphing to Diana—“Got
place Scotland, will you come?” What about
the hill now upon which Elsie had imagined herself
standing looking down upon poor Marcus?</p>

<p>When Diana got the telegram she read it aloud,
and Elsie began feebly about a picnic—and more
picnics—and a possible dance—and more dances,
but Diana’s heart was already in the Highlands.
“Darling Uncle Man!” she cried. “Delicious old
Marky Man!” And Marcus put his head under her
hand and swallowed with gratitude. “Not you,
you darling, blessed black angel,” she said.</p>

<p>“Bribery and corruption,” said Aunt Elsie, as
she pulled furiously at the weeds in the garden;
“pure bribery—it isn’t that the child cares for
him—she only goes—because she wants to go
to Scotland. I shall at least have Dick. He would
never desert me.” And to make sure of that she
went in and wrote to Dick—wrote of cricket
matches—wrote in glowing terms, showing an
amazing knowledge of the game, which she felt
was bound to impress a small nephew. To which
letter Dick wrote back:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Aunt Elsie</span>,—It’s jolly decent of you,
but I’m a bit fed up with cricket, and what’s more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
I might get stale if I played too much, and what’s
still more to the purpose is that Taboret Major has
asked me to go to Scotland. His people have taken
a sort of castle there—what d’you say to that?
Don’t say no and break the heart of your anxious
nephew. Taboret Major says it’s a rippin’ place
and there’s lots of shooting and fishing. Old Wane
says it’s a chance that shouldn’t be missed—so
I say.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="padding-right: 4em">Your loving and hopeful</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Dick</span><br>
</p>

<p>P.S. What about my being confirmed next term?
Do you think I need? I don’t feel much like it at
present and Taboret Major isn’t going to be because
he’s going to join the Scotch religion. I expect
I shall be converted when I’m in Scotland, so
had I better wait to see? But then I ought to say
that Taboret Major is going to wear a kilt. I expect this
makes a difference. What do you think?</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>So even Dick was denied her, and Elsie went out
into her garden where the borders were full of
blossoms which Diana loved, and into the kitchen
garden where grew vegetable marrows, things
which Dick had sworn he loved, and the aunt felt
she had laboured in vain. She had sown and Uncle
Marcus would reap.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Is</span> there any waking up in this world to be compared
with the waking up in Scotland after a
night spent in the train?</p>

<p>Is there any air so thin and clear as the air one
breathes on stepping out to the station platform?
Would a man be anywhere else on God’s earth?
No, not if he be a sportsman and something of a
Scotsman. It is not necessary to be more than that
to make one eager to claim kinship with every one
as one stands for the first time after many months
on Scottish ground. Marcus bethought himself of
the portrait of an ancestress of his wearing a tartan
sash and blessed her for having worn it and for
having passed on to him something of her love for
the Highlands that had lain in her heart beneath
the tartan band.</p>

<p>As Marcus stood on the platform he pointed out
to Diana its many beauties. God had willed that
there should be no mist that morning—and no
veil hung between them and the moor—purpling
with promise of deeper things to come. Diana said
that, and Marcus enthused in his turn over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
convolvulus that scrambled over the white wooden
paling as it scrambles nowhere else: nowhere else,
perhaps, is it so worth while scrambling to get over
the paling.</p>

<p>“It’s good to be alive!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Delicious!” said Diana, sniffing; “isn’t it good?
How much longer shall we be before we get there?”</p>

<p>Marcus said some hours, but Diana didn’t mind
how many. The people at the stations interested
her; the barefooted, sandy-haired, freckled boys,
the barefooted, shy, proud little girls; fisherwomen,
old and young, pretty and pretty once upon a time—long
ago. She loved the shivering pointers and
setters—shivering with excitement only—she
knew that—waiting while their masters and men
disinterred deeply buried luggage. Stalwart keepers
meeting parties interested her and she knew she
witnessed the meeting of old friends. She loved the
keepers and wondered if Marcus and she would
have a nice one of their own? What a thing it is to
own for even two months a Scotch keeper! Marcus
assured her all keepers in Scotland were nice. They
were a race apart—a race of fine gentlemen.</p>

<p>“Darlings,” said Diana; “it’s a heavenly place.”
Then she wondered what Glenbossie would be like?
And Marcus knew exactly. It would be a smallish
house—stucco, whitewashed; it might have a
tropæolum growing over the porch. The woodwork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
of the house would be painted a clarety brown;
there might be strings of convolvulus up the walls,
and there would be pegs on which to lay the fishing-rods
under the sloping roof.</p>

<p>“It will be a lodge,” said Diana with some
anxiety; “not a proper house?”</p>

<p>“A lodge, of course; certainly not a proper
house.”</p>

<p>“It would be horrible if it were a proper house.”</p>

<p>“Uncanny, positively,” agreed Marcus.</p>

<p>“You will love being uncomfortable, won’t
you?” asked Diana.</p>

<p>Marcus looked anxious, but smiled as he said,
“Yes, of course”; for he knew his Oven and his
Pillar.</p>

<p>Pillar came along the train at most stations to
tell Mr. Maitland it looked like fine weather and
that the luggage was in at the front.</p>

<p>Mrs. Oven never moved. Her heart was sick for
her London kitchen and all it contained—its
electrical contrivances. She didn’t look forward
except with dismay to a lodge that was not a proper
house. But going to Scotland was an act of madness
committed by the best families and it was
very expensive. She knew, of course, that people
who live in Scotland, whose homes are there, live
in the greatest comfort, that the best cooks come
from Scotland; it is only of those people who go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
from England for two months and live in places
they would never think of living in in England,
and paying enormous sums to do so, she was
thinking.</p>

<p>The scullery-maid refused to look out of the
window. She preferred to read. She knew what the
country looked like. She had been to Epping Forest
twice. Books for her, please! The kitchen-maid
was from Skye. She hung out of the window drinking
it all in. The housemaid tried to sleep. She was
a bad traveller. She had nothing to say against
Skye, but as they weren’t going there there was
no need to think about it. It was beds she was
thinking of. The mattresses wouldn’t be “box,”
she was despondingly certain of that. “Not even
spring, I should say,” Mrs. Oven said. At one of
the stations—a small private station—the train
stopped to take up a party of fishermen—a man,
a girl, and a boy. The gillies got into the next compartment
with the rods and landing-nets. Marcus
glanced quickly at Diana. She looked perfectly
fresh, tidy, and delightful. Her eyes sparkled. She
was hoping Uncle Marcus would speak. She remembered
a horrible story he was wont to tell of
two men who had lived for twenty years in the
same house in Jermyn Street, who had never
spoken to each other, although they met constantly
on the stairs. He had seemed proud of the story as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
illustrating something rather fine in the English
character, but now, throwing all Jermyn Street
restraint to the winds, he spoke. He asked them
what luck they had had. The boy started off to
tell him. He took ten minutes to tell how he had
lost a fish. The girl, in one, told how she had seen
one. The man had got two. Moreover, he prophesied
that by tea-time Diana would have got one—if
not more—to her own rod. “You are for Glenbossie?”
he said to Marcus. And Marcus said he
was and that Diana was his niece.</p>

<p>“Nice people,” said Diana when they had gone,
and Marcus beamed. Where was Aunt Elsie now?
Scotland was the place to bring a girl to, of course.
What was the good of picnics and dances? English
picnics! English dances!</p>

<p>At last they arrived at the station that for two
months was to be their own. Marcus had never
seemed to care for a station before—had never
before patted one on the back, as it were. Diana
was amused to see him greet the station-master as
his best friend in the world. He looked as though
he were longing to tell him how glad he was he had
elected to be a station-master. It was delightful
to Diana. She had never seen Marcus purring to
this extent. She had known him very polite, but
this was something far pleasanter, and much funnier.
The station-master was his long-lost brother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
that was all. So was the keeper: Macpherson by
name: and more of a brother than any—an elder
brother—was John. John with a wrinkled face
and a twinkle in his eyes. Nature is a wonderful
needle-woman when she takes the time and trouble
to “gather” an old face. She had made thousands
of “gathers” on John’s face without in any way
spoiling the material, and Diana loved every
wrinkle. Most of them stood for smiles and many
of them for sunshine. “I shall love John,” she confided
to Marcus.</p>

<p>“Dear old man,” said Marcus, and Diana was
further amused. If Scotland could do this for one
man—then Scotland forever, for all men. There
was a lorry for the luggage—a car for Marcus and
Diana, and for the household a kind of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">char-à-banc</i>,
Pillar presiding over all and preventing Marcus
from interfering. He showed no excitement.
He knew his Scotland; if not one part, then another.
They were all the same. In one, less grouse
than in another—seldom more: in another, more
fishing: scenery more or less the same in all parts.
Mountains higher in one part than another—nothing
much to choose between them—and
midges everywhere. He himself had a weakness
for sea-fishing, but would quite understand if Mr.
Maitland had forgotten to remember it. In the
back of his head he had a shrewd suspicion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
they had come to Scotland for a set purpose—that
Scotland was to be the means of marrying
Miss Diana—and of defeating Miss Carston. It
was always easy to get the right kind of gentlemen
to come to Scotland, not that there had been any
great difficulty in London, but gentlemen would
recklessly face a recognized danger for the chance
of a “royal”—whereas for a dinner—well, in
London they were cautious. Pillar had an idea,
unexpressed, that Miss Diana would prove highly
dangerous in Scotland. He had faith—the utmost
faith—in her tweeds and boots. She would make
no sartorial mistakes—moreover, the more like
a boy she looked the better she looked. They arrived
at Glenbossie. It was exactly as Marcus had
described it: a low, white house set on a hillside;
surrounded by moor. On one side was a birch wood;
a short distance below the lodge ran the river, getting,
of course, lower and lower every minute as
rivers will. Where were the rods? Marcus asked,
all eagerness to begin fishing. The <em>rods</em> had arrived!
Pillar said it with such emphasis that Marcus asked
what had not arrived?</p>

<p>“The stores, sir.” A happy gloom here expressed
itself on every feature of Pillar’s face.</p>

<p>“The stores? Oh, that doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Pillar.</p>

<p>“What sort of stores?” asked Marcus, this resignation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
beautiful in its selflessness, on the part
of Pillar looked bad.</p>

<p>“Oh, just ordinary stores, sir, tea and coffee and
sugar, jam, marmalade, bacon, vermicelli, rice,
oil, vinegar, sultanas, raisins, every kind of cereal,
tapioca—macaroni—pickles.”</p>

<p>Now many of these things Marcus hated, but
he wanted them all the same. He didn’t see why
the railway company should have them. There
was Mrs. Oven to keep happy, but it would take
more than stores, it appeared, to make Mrs. Oven
happy. The fire wouldn’t burn.</p>

<p>“Dog, dog won’t bite,” quoted Diana, and Marcus
told her not to be irrelevant.</p>

<p>The oven wouldn’t heat itself, let alone water.</p>

<p>“Piggy won’t get over the stile—don’t worry,”
said Diana; “it’s all too delicious. The station-master
is still your brother, and Macpherson your
keeper—”</p>

<p>Macpherson! Good idea! What about Mrs. Macpherson?
Pillar would enquire. He enquired and
came back to say she was a most respectable woman
and had flour and tea and washing soda—</p>

<p>“If she would be so kind—” Marcus was beginning
when Pillar respectfully broke in to say
she would be kinder than that—moreover, she
understood the stove. It could heat water and it
could bake—the oven could. “It was just the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
puir gals from London who didna understand the
ways of it.”</p>

<p>Pillar prided himself on his Scotch. He spoke it
as well as many actors on the London stage speak
it and with less effort.</p>

<p>When dinner-time came, into her own came Mrs.
Oven. Whatever disappointment she had expressed,
annoyance she had shown, she now proved that her
cunning had not left her. There was a dinner and
an excellent dinner. Women are wonderful creatures,
and with the help of cows and hens there is
no limit to what they can do if they set their minds
to it.</p>

<p>Before Marcus and Diana went to bed that first
night, when their fates as regarded beds and mattresses
were still hid from them, Marcus called to
Diana to come out. They stood in front of the
lodge, Diana like a wraith in the moonlight—an
exquisite visitant from another world.</p>

<p>“Listen!” said Marcus, and they heard the call
of the cock grouse on the hillside, the weird cry of
the plover, the soft rushing of the river, and it was
all very, very good. And it would have been better
still if that haunting question had not come back
to torment the poor uncle. “Is she in love?” Did
Elsie know of whom Diana was thinking as she
stood there looking so horribly, so bound to be, in
love?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“What are you thinking of?” he asked.</p>

<p>The moment was fraught with possibilities. At
such a moment as this she might say what was in
her heart, and if she did, and he found she was
thinking of a suitable young man, he might say
something of what he meant to do for her when
she married. It was dangerous, he knew, to commit
one’s self, but still—</p>

<p>“Would you mind frightfully if I wore a kilt,
because I think I must—darling, you <em>don’t</em>
mind—”</p>

<p>“Is that what you were thinking of?”</p>

<p>“No—darling—shall I tell you? I am a little
shy about it. I—”</p>

<p>“Don’t be shy.”</p>

<p>“Well—you look most awfully—what shall I
say?—handsome is not the word, is it?—alluring—no,
not that—distractingly elusive—yes, that’s
it—at the same time you look as if you might be—are
you—in love? Tell me—don’t be shy—is
it—Elsie?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Marcus was far from being in love with Elsie,
but she was always at his elbow as it were. Whenever
Diana seemed particularly happy, he thought
of Elsie and wondered what she would do to get
Diana back? What attractions she would dare to
offer? There was nothing he wouldn’t do to show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
Diana how infinitely to be preferred was Scotland
above any other country, how much nicer than
aunts were uncles. And Diana responded by walking
like a gazelle and climbing like a goat; that
was as far as Marcus could go in describing her particular
grace and amazing activity. The first salmon
he hooked he handed to Diana to play. She played
and lost it, and he swore he would have done likewise—and
the gillie agreed with him. But he had
seen “wurrrse fishermen cert’nly,” he would no be
denying it. “Mister Maitland was a fair fisherman,
but not so good a fisherman as he thought himself
to be.” When Marcus realized how Sandy ached for
the feel of the rod, he let him feel it now and then,
and he went up by leaps and bounds, as a fisherman
and a God-fearing man in the eyes of Sandy.</p>

<p>Marcus was at his best when Diana was with
him: he shot better and fished better under the
spur of her generous admiration and encouragement;
and of Elsie and her picnics and her croquet
parties, and even her dances, he could think with
a pity that was almost tender. He had plenty of
opportunities in which to win Diana’s confidence,
and he imagined she gave it to him with a fine
honesty that he found particularly gratifying. Mr.
Watkins he dismissed with a gesture—it was impossible
Diana could think seriously for one moment
of a minor poet. Mr. Pease? Another gesture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
and he was as nothing—he no longer existed. He
was not for Diana. The young man in London
troubled him. St. Jermyn was his name. He had
nothing against him except that he had shown
symptoms of possessing that power of attracting
the whole attention and sympathy of a woman
that Eustace Carston had shown. Had Diana the
same power of devotion her mother had? The
thought was disquieting. Diana would not say anything
about the man except that he had danced
better than any other—that was all. She vowed
that Uncle Marcus alone held her heart: could
hold her heart among the heather and the burns
and the lochs: that he fitted in with the surroundings
as no other man could. No man could be so
interesting, no man so Scotch! If only he would
wear a kilt! She would so love it!</p>

<p>Although Diana wanted no one but Uncle Marcus,
a great many men found their way to Glenbossie.
Men from up the river and down the river
came with offerings of beats and butts. Men from
the neighbouring moors brought offerings in the
way of days—a day’s driving later on; a day’s
stalking. Marcus had these things of his own, but
he found he would have to share them and sharing
them would mean sharing Diana.</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Marcus one evening, “that I
could see some of these men you talk about, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
that I might judge of them for myself. I should like
to guide you in your choice.”</p>

<p>“Do, darling,” said Diana.</p>

<p>“But I can’t without seeing them.”</p>

<p>“Well, ask them here.”</p>

<p>But that was more than he could do. There was
nothing Diana couldn’t do when she tried. In the
village (village?—Mrs. Oven couldn’t see where
the village came in, but for all that it existed)
there was an inn, a kirk, a general merchant, and
that, with a few old people, and a few young men
and women, and a few barelegged children, constituted
Loch Bossie. The inn stood at the side
of the road, and with the inn went fishing—bad
fishing, perhaps, but fishing: and the people who
had taken it this season could not come because
their children had developed scarlet fever, which
dispensation of Providence Mrs. MacFie—innkeeper—accepted
as one to be borne with unwavering
faith, and thankfulness that it was not
worse. It meant for her the rent in her pocket and
something more in the shape of compensation, and
no one to feed or to fash about. So she was well
content, though sorry for the poor things, of course.
But it was a sorrow she could very well bear and
she was bearing it very well, when into the inn
walked an apparition. Mrs. MacFie didn’t call
Diana by that name, although Mr. Watkins might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
have done so; and so might Mrs. MacFie if she
had thought of it.</p>

<p>The apparition wore a tweed that went with her
eyes, and the whole of Scotland went with her hair:
and there was that in her voice that softened the
heart of Mrs. MacFie, and in ten minutes Mrs.
MacFie had promised the rooms, and the fishing
at a moderate cost; and as many scones, dropped
and griddled, as they could eat, to two young men
who had been since the days they were born the
solaces of their respective mothers.</p>

<p>According to Diana they neither drank nor did
they eat to any appreciable extent. They liked
whatever was set before them; and they were prepared
to love Mrs. MacFie. That Diana implied
rather than said: and she walked away, swinging
as she walked as lightly as a silver birch dances
blown by the breeze. Mrs. MacFie watched her,
and that was how it struck her, and she went back
into the house glad that the tenant at Glenbossie
liked Scotland so well. It showed good sense and a
good heart and the young leddy was no doubt in
love with one of the young gentlemen, perhaps
with both, and would be having them up so that
she might choose between them; which was not
exactly as matters stood, but near enough.</p>

<p>Diana wrote to Mr. Pease and to Mr. Watkins
and they wrote back to say they would come. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Watkins had never fished, but was willing to try,
and Mr. Pease had fished all his life, but had caught
little. The prospect of good fishing filled him with
delight. There was no sport in the world like it.
Had Miss Diana ever considered how full the New
Testament was of fishing? It was very encouraging—particularly
to all bishops and curates.</p>

<p>Diana walked softly the day she got the letters.
It was not only that Uncle Marcus should know
him that she had asked Mr. Pease to come; not
only that he should know Mr. Watkins that she
had asked Mr. Watkins to come, but that they
should enjoy themselves and that Mr. Pease should
catch much fish.</p>

<p>She was of so delightful a nature that what she
enjoyed she wanted others to enjoy. The thought
of Mr. Pease riding up and down Bestways hills on
his bicycle, ministering to the souls and bodies of
old men and women, seemed, viewed from the
moors of Scotland, where souls had such a chance,
rather a sad lot. Uncle Marcus could well afford to
give both Mr. Pease and Mr. Watkins a holiday.
They would never question the smallness of the
rent asked for the fishing, so Marcus could hide
his light under a bushel and could easily escape
the thanks he dreaded.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Diana</span> did everything that was asked of her
as tenant of Glenbossie and more. She loved
the Minister’s wife, her soft voice and gentle manner,
and when she asked Diana to come to the Sale,
to be held in the schools, Diana said, of course she
would come, and on the appointed day she went
down to the schools with her pockets full of Uncle
Marcus’s money, and on her way she passed old
women whom she loved for the mutches they wore,
and for the smiles within them. Every one had a
soft word for her and a smile. When she got to the
schools she did not stop to wonder why so many
people were gathered together outside the door.
They made way for her, and she went in and she
bought all the shirts and all the socks: praised the
making of them—and wondered at their strength
and their softness—the softness of the socks and
strength of the shirts. She bought other things,
less useful, and perhaps not strictly beautiful, but
she paid for them all right royally.</p>

<p>As she was the only person there she bought
everything she could lay hands on, remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
the soft voice and the gentle manner of the Minister’s
wife. One or two stall-holders, she remembered
afterwards, did protest faintly: but she
thought they were only afraid she was being too
generous.</p>

<p>Having bought most things she rested from her
labours, and walking to the window looked out,
and saw sailing down upon the schoolhouse a
party consisting of a very small, but very important-looking
mother, and a charming-looking
daughter and several other people, and she knew
them to be the Scott party. Very important people
were the Scotts—very important was their
party. It was trimmed with white heather. The
men wore kilts and the women the next best things.
They all wore tartan stockings and some—some
men, bonnets.</p>

<p>Diana’s heart began to fail. The Minister was
at the door to meet the Scott party and he welcomed
Mrs. Scott and them all with great ceremony,
and Mrs. Scott smiled upon him and said
how delighted she was to open the bazaar.</p>

<p>The Minister consulted his watch in answer to
her question, “Was she late?” and it was found
she was not late.</p>

<p>“Not late, perhaps,” thought Diana, “but
everything was sold!”</p>

<p>After the opening of the Sale with prayer, Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Scott proclaimed it ready for buyers and she hoped
that people would buy as many things as they
could, and spend as much money as they—had—no,
not that; but as much as they could spare! The
crowd that had gathered outside now filled the hall.</p>

<p>The first shirt Mrs. Scott lost her heart to was
sold, and the next. And the socks? Yes, sold!</p>

<p>Then Diana went round to all the stall-holders
and assured them she had bought nothing—they
might keep the money, but the things must be
sold again. “Let me have afterwards what Mrs.
Scott doesn’t want,” she said. Mrs. Scott thanked
Diana for coming, said she remembered her so well,
at the—whose ball, was it? She told her Ralph
St. Jermyn was coming to stay with them. “But
I must do my duty. Have you found anything to
buy? It is so kind of you. There will be lots for
us all.” And she went on her way buying all the
things Diana had already bought. It was a very
good way of selling from the stall-holders’ point
of view, and they had never made so much before
at any sale in Loch Bossie, and in Scotland they
make more by bazaars than in any other country
in the world.</p>

<p>Diana made her escape so soon as she could,
greatly to the disappointment of some of the Scott
party, and she vowed to Uncle Marcus she would
never go to another sale so long as she lived. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
asked her at what time she had gone, and she said
at three o’clock—why?</p>

<p>He said he had only wondered because the Sale
was to be opened at half-past three by Mrs. Scott.</p>

<p>“She must never know,” said Diana.</p>

<p>“Never!” agreed Uncle Marcus, and he put out
his hand for the change (there are very few men
who don’t ask for change) and he did not express
that pleasure he ought to have experienced when
he realized how greatly the Sale had benefitted by
the officiousness of his niece.</p>

<p>When the parcel came from the bazaar for Diana
there were within it neither the socks she had
promised Pillar, nor the shirts longed for by John
and Sandy, but only those things Mrs. Scott and
others had not been requiring.</p>

<p>Two egg-cosies in tartan cloth.</p>

<p>One piano-key-cover in dark brown serge, worked
in yellow silks.</p>

<p>One tea-cosy crocheted in string, lined with red
sateen.</p>

<p>One shoe-bag in brown holland and bound with
green braid.</p>

<p>One crazy patchwork cushion cover.</p>

<p>One bib.</p>

<p>One turkey twill bedspread—</p>

<p>“I should like to see the things you bought,”
said Uncle Marcus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“You shall see them all this evening,” said
Diana softly.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t buy any rubbish. I hate
money wasted. Stockings and shirts are always
useful.”</p>

<p>Then Diana persuaded Pillar to lay out all Mr.
Maitland’s clothes on the bed, chairs, and tables in
one of the spare bedrooms after dinner, and Pillar,
because Miss Diana asked him to do it—did it.</p>

<p>“Particularly his boots, miss, you want, his
shooting-clothes, and his shirts? Yes, miss.”</p>

<p>“How many pairs of boots are there?” she asked.</p>

<p>Pillar pondered, and when he gave the number
of pairs—“approximately, miss”—Diana said
six of them would do.</p>

<p>And at half-past nine that night Diana told
Uncle Marcus the things were all ready, laid out,
in the spare room. She put out her hand inviting
him to come, and he followed her upstairs and
came into the room and saw spread upon the tables,
bed, and chairs, things he must least have expected
to see.</p>

<p>“Boots?” he asked, “<em>these</em> boots?” He took one
up; looked at it, and put it down again. From that
to another pair—from the boots he went to tweed
coats, knickerbockers, trousers. “Was this as one
would meet old friends?” thought Diana—“without
one smile?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>From the blue shirt to the pink striped one,
went Marcus; from the mauve silk one to the
black-and-white striped one. From shirts to pyjamas;
he had never thought he had so many, or
such good ones. Back to the boots. He was perfectly
serious and Diana wondered of what he was
thinking? “You look very serious,” she said.</p>

<p>“It is very serious,” he answered. “You got a
lot for your money, that’s all I can say—the rest
of the matter I must put into the hands of the
police.”</p>

<p>“Police?” asked Diana.</p>

<p>“My dear child, it’s clearly a case of stealing.
Some one has sold my clothes, and although the
money may be given to the poor it won’t do.”
And he went—bound, Diana was sure, for the
Police Station.</p>

<p>She was so distressed that it was more than the
respectfully tender heart of Pillar could stand, and
he told her, begging her pardon, that Mr. Maitland
had been “in the know,” as it were. “You told
him?” she asked, surprised and indignant.</p>

<p>“Well, miss, I couldn’t have done it without
his leave.”</p>

<p>But the joke was spoilt! Not entirely, said Pillar,
there was no reason he should know she knew.
There was generally the other side to a joke.</p>

<p>“You mean,” said Diana, “that I must let Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Maitland think that I am very much distressed—that
I believe about the policeman?”</p>

<p>“Let things go their own way, miss. It’s safest
with jokes—certainly where single gentlemen—of
a certain age—are concerned.”</p>

<p>And she let things go their own way, and this is
the way they naturally went. Uncle Marcus went
downstairs looking very serious, and Diana followed
him a few minutes later, looking very distressed.</p>

<p>He sat down at his table to write to the police.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she said, and laid a restraining hand
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“My dear child, I must. It cannot be left as it is.”</p>

<p>“What do you suspect—<em>who</em> do you suspect?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“I suspect that my things have been sold by
some one to some one—else, and by some means
or other they found their way to the bazaar, and
by some strange chance you bought them.”</p>

<p>Diana said, being the niece of her uncle, it was
only natural that she should know good boots when
she saw them.</p>

<p>This appeared to soften Uncle Marcus towards
Diana, but in no other way was he to be moved.</p>

<p>“You don’t suspect—Pillar?” she said softly.
She was anxious to find out the way the joke was
going—she thought it had got lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>Marcus paused—it was a serious thing to say,
even in fun—“I have reason to doubt him,” he
admitted.</p>

<p>Then up spake Diana: her eyes shining, her
cheeks ablaze. She recounted—Marcus couldn’t
have done it better himself—in fact she had got
it all from him—the many and varied perfections
of Pillar. His most excellent qualities—she had
them all at her finger’s ends. As she talked Marcus’s
heart warmed afresh towards the man he would as
soon have suspected as himself of stealing—but
Diana? Was she going to allow him to send for the
policeman? Would she carry her joke to that extremity?
He knew the note would go no further
than Pillar: but she did not know that.</p>

<p>“Unless you can throw some light on the matter,
this letter must go.” And he wrote the letter, pausing
between the words, blackening the down
strokes, rounding the <em>e</em>’s; still Diana said nothing,
and Uncle Marcus gave his letter to Pillar to send
at once. Whereupon Diana burst into tears and
left the room.</p>

<p>Outside the door there were no tears to be wiped
away, but there was much to be done. She had to
find a policeman; not so difficult that as it sounded.
It only meant going so far as the next lodge and
borrowing the first young man she could find; and
off she went, having told a housemaid to lock her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
bedroom door on the outside, and take the key
away.</p>

<p>“Then if Uncle Marcus comes to comfort me,”
she thought, “he will find the door locked.”</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus sat and waited. He made up his
mind to wait five minutes. He could not let any
woman cry for longer. They were fearfully long
minutes. But they passed and he went upstairs.
He knocked at the door. There was no answer, for
by that time Diana was halfway to the next lodge.</p>

<p>“Diana?” Still no answer.</p>

<p>He waited. He heard her sob—was sure of it—confound
the joke—“Diana!” No answer.</p>

<p>By this time Diana was at the next lodge; and
was in the very act of coaching a young man—only
too ready to be coached in anything by Diana,
whom he had worshipped from afar the whole of
one morning; from the other side of the river, to
be exact—and he was perfectly willing to be a
policeman if it made her happy.</p>

<p>“Can you talk Scotch?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Do you mean Gaelic?”</p>

<p>“Yes; if you can do that, it’s better still, because
Uncle Marcus ‘has not’ Gaelic.” He could talk
Gaelic, and he understood English. He laughed:
in his present mood this seemed a good joke, and
Diana laughed, too, which showed she was kind: then
she asked, “How did Scotch policemen dress?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
The young man was sure—in blue. Diana decided
he must wear a mackintosh. Uncle Marcus
would be much too agitated to see anything: the
mere sight of a policeman would be paralyzing to
one of his temperament. The young man asked if
Mr. Maitland would be likely to see the joke.</p>

<p>“Jokes are difficult things to deal with,” admitted
Diana. “There are better jokes than those
we don’t see: and there are none so good as those
we see. It gives Uncle Marcus a way out.”</p>

<p>Down the road walked Diana with the policeman
to be, while Uncle Marcus pleaded, through a
locked door, with a Diana not there. Then he grew
stuffy and offended as he always did in time, being
of so affectionate and sensitive a nature, and he
went downstairs to the smoking-room, muttering
to himself that if she didn’t want to, he didn’t,
and so on. He took up his “Scotsman.” How often
had he found a refuge behind its generous pages,
and he had only just taken up his position of offended
dignity when the door opened and Pillar
announced the arrival of the policeman.</p>

<p>“Idiot!” said Mr. Maitland, meaning Pillar, of
course, and in walked the policeman.</p>

<p>“Just one moment,” said Marcus, jumping up;
“I must ask some one something before we go
any further.” And he went upstairs, two steps at
a time, to Diana’s room, and found her door still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
locked. He tried it again and again, which took
time: and while he was upstairs the real policeman
happened to call for a subscription to a most deserving
charity (the news of the generosity of the
Glenbossie tenant had spread abroad like wild fire)
and the pseudo-policeman retired in favour of the
real thing, in the cause of charity.</p>

<p>When Mr. Maitland came down he did not notice
the change—a policeman is a policeman to
the law-abiding citizen, whether in a mackintosh
or not.</p>

<p>“I am afraid there has been some mistake,” he
began, careful to seat himself back to the light:
that much he had learned from much reading—in
his youth—of detective stories. The policeman
politely remarked that we were all liable—as
human creatures—to make mistakes. Which
axiom, pronounced in broad Scotch—of all accents
the most comforting—sounded the kindest
and most cheerful, as well as the most Christian,
thing Marcus had heard for many a long day. Of
course the policeman spoke generally, knowing
nothing of any particular mistake. Mr. Maitland
hastened to say he was sorry he had troubled him,
and the policeman very naturally said the trouble
was to be Mr. Maitland’s. Marcus felt that acutely:
there was no need to remind him of it.</p>

<p>“Now about the note—” began Marcus. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the genial policeman said: One would do, although
he would not be refusing more, if Mr. Maitland
should be feeling so disposed—and he put out his
capacious hand.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Maitland grasped the fact that the
honest policeman was open to a bribe, and he
pressed into his hand a larger number of notes
than the honest policeman had ever hoped to hold—in
the cause of charity. It was a good charity
and deserving—whatever! And the policeman
left the presence of Mr. Maitland a happy man;
and the other policeman left the presence of Diana
a most unhappy man—deeply and, he believed,
hopelessly in love.</p>

<p>When Marcus, making a final attempt, knocked
at Diana’s door, he found it unlocked and a
smothered voice told him to come in.</p>

<p>He went in. Diana was hidden under the bedclothes;
she emerged at his urgent request. “Diana,
my child, I am so sorry.”</p>

<p>He looked at her: she was one of those happy
women, he thought, who can cry without its leaving
any disfiguring trace.</p>

<p>“It was only my joke writing to the policeman,”
he said, smiling as though asking pity for his
simplicity.</p>

<p>“And it was only mine in sending for him.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> sent for him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Diana nodded.</p>

<p>“But think of what Pillar must have thought!”</p>

<p>“Pillar knew—” said Diana; then, seeing
Uncle Marcus’s look of astonishment, explained.
“Pillar would no more think of sending for a policeman
without asking me than he would think of
spreading out your clothes without asking you—he
is wonderful!—Pillar!”</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus looked at Diana—if her hair had
been done in one pigtail instead of two, and her
eyes had not been so innocent and truthful in their
appeal, he would have been very, very angry. As
it was he looked so kind that she ventured: “Mine
wasn’t a real—policeman.”</p>

<p>“Not a real policeman? Then who was he?”</p>

<p>“Just a man staying at the Lodge up the river.”</p>

<p>“And I gave him ten pounds!”</p>

<p>“No, darling; that was to the real policeman
who happened to come for a subscription. We
changed policemen while you were upstairs asking
my advice. You were upstairs with me while I was
downstairs with two policemen: it all sounds rather
muddling, but it’s really quite simple.”</p>

<p>“What an ass he must have thought me!” said
Marcus, thinking of the real policeman.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he just thought you were the English
tenant of Glenbossie, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Marcus got up and, walking about the room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
came to a standstill before a pile of things on the
top of a chest of drawers. “What are these abominations?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“The things I bought at the bazaar,” said Diana,
disappearing under the bedclothes.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Scott met Marcus she said: “It was
so good of him to subscribe so largely to their cottage
hospital.” And Marcus said: “Not at all!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> evening in August there went out from
Euston, bound for Scotland, two men, each
with his heart full of Diana. There went also yet
another and his heart, too, was full of Diana. Her
address he had learnt was Glenbossie, and to Glenbossie
he was going, although he had no invitation.
Nevertheless he did not despair. God is ever on the
side of youth, and—if youth had not been asked
to the Lodge he was going to the station, and where
a Loch Bossie station is there is bound to be a
Glenbossie Lodge. Wandering along the platform
at Euston, seeing again all the things—familiar
things—of which abroad he had dreamed every
August and onwards—men and dogs, gun cases
and fishing-rod cases—he came upon a prodigiously
long fishing-rod case. It must belong, he
thought, to a renowned fisherman, or to one who
had fished little. Guarding the rod case, almost
jealously, he saw what he guessed to be a parson,
with a light in his eyes, not of this world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>No one knew better than Miles Hastings what
starting for Scotland meant, but he had learnt to
keep his face in order, whatever liberties his heart
might take. Approaching the owner of the long rod
case he read the label attached—“Watkins, Loch
Bossie.”</p>

<p>Now Miles Hastings was a lucky young man,
but this was more than even he could have expected.
Here was one who could tell him all he
wanted to know, so he set about to make friends
with Watkins, of Loch Bossie; but he found it was
with one Pease he made friends, who but guarded
the treasure of Watkins.</p>

<p>Miles had a genius for making friends, and a
charming frankness that endeared him at sight to
old ladies, old men, men and women generally, and
children in particular. He was devoted to all animals
especially if they were young, and as to
puppies, he was as putty in their paws. There was
nothing he would not give a puppy if “asked for
it” properly. In winter-time he would rescue little
birds in the snow: take them home and revive
them. He would go out of his way to help anything
that could not help itself. In addition to this he
was good to look at, a wholesome, fine young
Englishman, and in all this there lay danger, Sir
Eustace thought, danger to Diana: and against it
he would have protected her. Also he wanted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
protect himself against the possibility of having
to say No, if Hastings should ask him for Diana,
which if he met her he was bound to do. Sir Eustace
would have liked to be able to say, “My
dear boy, there is no one in the world to whom I
would rather give her!” “And why not say it?”
thought Sibyl Carston, who was one of those who
held strongly the belief that things must turn out
all right in the end, and so strong was her faith in
the good that must come to those who look for it
that it generally did come. It had come to her,
why not to Diana? Life had been very good to
Miles Hastings: the world had treated him very
kindly, surely it would go on being kind. His was
a nature that only expected what it gave in overflowing
measure itself—just kindness—surely
there should be no difficulty about that.</p>

<p>So he made friends with Pease, thinking to himself:
“Here is a nice young thing, devoted to his
mother”—he looked like that—“who is going
off to fish, to catch bigger fish than he has ever
caught, bigger fish than the world has ever seen,
and better fish”; he hoped he might catch them.
But, by the way, where was Pease going, <em>exactly</em>?
Deep guile this, for Hastings knew, but Pease
knew not that Hastings knew. So he explained—with
an indifference assumed—that he was going
to the inn at Loch Bossie where the fishing was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
excellent—quite excellent! Yes, it was near Glenbossie
Lodge—yes, quite near!</p>

<p>Here Pease pulled at his pipe, giving pause to
think.</p>

<p>No, Glenbossie Lodge was not to let. Pease knew
that—had very good reasons for knowing it. It
was strange he should have been asked because he
was curiously cognizant of the state of affairs.</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Captain Hastings.</p>

<p>“I happen to know all about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thanks, I am only just back from
abroad; one gets a little rusty—I remember the
word, of course. Please go on.”</p>

<p>“I am able to give you the information, because
I happen to know the man who has taken it.”</p>

<p>Captain Hastings nodded. That was good evidence,
except that sometimes lodges at the last
moment were sub-let. Was it possible—?</p>

<p>“It is a sub-let as it is,” said Pease, interrupting
him.</p>

<p>“And who has taken it?”</p>

<p>“A Mr. Maitland.”</p>

<p>“A good chap?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I believe so, but I am—as it were—on
the other side.”</p>

<p>Captain Hastings looked puzzled and Mr. Pease
hastened to explain.</p>

<p>“You see there is a little family friction on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
subject of the guardianship of the children, during
the absence of their parents abroad, and I am
rather on the side of the aunt.”</p>

<p>Captain Hastings thought he looked as though
he would be, but did not say so. “You are going to
the Lodge, I suppose?” He knocked the ash off the
end of his cigar.</p>

<p>No, Mr. Pease was not going there. The fact of
the matter was Watkins also wanted a holiday—and
they were both going to the inn so—so as to
be near Glenbossie Lodge.</p>

<p>“And you?” asked Mr. Pease, feeling it was
now his turn to ask questions. Miles Hastings did
not say he was going to the Lodge, but he was.</p>

<p>“I shall hope to get into the inn,” he said modestly;
“from what you say it must be a most excellent
place.”</p>

<p>In the corner of a third-class compartment sat
Watkins, writing a poem to Diana. He had been
red with the rhyming possibilities of “glossy”
and “Bossie,” and it may be presumed that a very
minor poet is as eager to capture a rhyme as a
swallow is to catch a fly.</p>

<p>Pease intimated to Hastings that he personally
was enjoying the journey immensely—so far;
hinted that it was almost a pity they should have
to part; he supposed Captain Hastings had booked
a sleeper, otherwise they might have talked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
greater part of the night. Almost apologetically
Hastings confessed that he had booked a sleeper.
He was afraid he was a slave to comfort—it was
a terrible thing to confess to; but Pease said he
quite understood—he was only sorry for his own
sake—being a light sleeper he was quite ready to
talk.</p>

<p>Hastings gave him, at parting for the night, the
story of the old lady, the parson, and the sleeping-berth,
and felt it no poor thing to give. And
when he saw Pease next morning Pease was still
smiling. Whether it was the beginning of a new
smile, or the lasting impression of the one he had
worn the night before, when they had parted,
Hastings could not say. It was enough that a man
could smile after sitting up all night; it spoke well
for England and her sons. Miles smiled, too, happy
in thinking that perhaps on this very ground
Diana, not long ago, had stood. He did not know
the same thought filled the mind of Pease. Watkins
had chased elusive quantities during a long night.
He had neither had good sleep nor had he been able
to make bad poetry—so he was not happy and
he had never cared less for Pease. To the stranger,
he had taken a great dislike. What had such a man
to do with men like himself and Pease? Hard-working,
sensible men!</p>

<p>Hastings went with the two other men to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
inn, and there he laid siege to the heart of Mrs.
MacFie, and the quality of his smile was such that
her Scottish reserve melted beneath its warmth,
like butter beneath the rays of the sun, and she
promised to give him a bedroom: and if he would
be requiring it, a sitting-room; but Hastings would
not be requiring a sitting-room: he meant to sit
elsewhere—and for the matter of that to sleep
elsewhere—after the first night; but he did not
say that.</p>

<p>The first day, what there was left of it, he spent
quietly bearing all things with patience. He watched
Pease tangling and disentangling fishing-tackle:
watched Watkins reading a book on the <em>Salmo
salar</em>. For Pease he evinced a great liking and for
Watkins a profound pity, for he judged there was
to be no untruth to which Watkins would not
descend for the sake of a rhyme: whereas Pease
was honesty itself, which combined with an almost
childlike simplicity made him likable enough. That
night Miles Hastings slept. The following morning
he rose refreshed, if not quite a giant—and after
all why not a giant, since there are more kinds of
giants than one, if we are to believe the old story
of the man who applied to the Manager of a Travelling
Show for the advertised vacancy of giant?
“But you’re not even a big man,” protested the
manager; whereupon the man, drawing himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
up, said proudly: “No, I am the smallest giant in
the world!”</p>

<p>Miles might claim to be more than that. Pease
respected him immensely for his tweeds and his
tie: and Watkins envied him his inches.</p>

<p>After breakfast Miles started off for Glenbossie
Lodge and nothing of beauty escaped him as he
went. The clearness of the running river—too
clear for a fisherman—was for him at the moment
beautiful. The minutest flower that grew in
the cranny of a rock filled him, on this wonderful
morning, with delight; because everything in nature
sang of Diana. All beauty was but a tribute
to hers. He laughed as the sheep scuttled out of his
path. The scent of the bog-myrtle rose like incense
on the air: the sandy road with its heather-topped
ruts was good going: the wide stretches of moor on
either side of him invited him to climb the hills to
which they gently led: the rocks scattered here and
there in the heather challenged him to guess how
they had come there. Great boulders they were
that no man could move, certainly not the smallest
giant in the world.</p>

<p>The curlew called to him: the gulls plainly
enough told him to go away—the sky was theirs—not
his: the sea and all that therein was—theirs,
not his. A little child padded past him, too
shy to answer his greeting; but not too shy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
smile hers. The burns gurgling down from the hillside
laughed at him—chuckled over jokes of their
own, which jokes were hidden either deep down
in “pots,” or by the heather that touched hands
over the laughing waters.</p>

<p>Hastings knew what good jokes little trout can
be, and if he had been younger they might have
kept him,—even from Diana,—but now nothing
could do that: everything bade him hurry, the
golden-rod at the side of the road waved to him:
the blue and pink scabious nodded: everything
sympathized with him.</p>

<p>An old woman making hay, in a patch of a field,
at the side of the road, came down to the low stone
wall and greeted him in her soft native tongue;
which greeting conveyed to him a wish for good
luck in his wooing. She understood! Her smiling,
sunken eyes held memories. It must have been
years ago that she was wooed, yet she had not forgotten!
Who could forget, if it had been among
these hills, beside these burns, under this sky that
he had loved? O Scotland! No wonder Shan’t addressed
her letters to Uncle Marcus “Glenbossie,
darlin’ Scotland.”</p>

<p>Arrived at the Lodge, Miles went up the pebbly
path that led to the door, rang the bell—and waited.</p>

<p>Pillar came to the wide-open door. “Good-morning,”
said Captain Hastings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” said Pillar.</p>

<p>“I have an order—” Then he repented him of
his wickedness and said, “Would you allow me to
see over the house?”</p>

<p>“It is let, sir.”</p>

<p>“Let? What scoundrels they are—agents—letting
me come all this way—for how long is it let?”</p>

<p>“For two months, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, of course, but I am in negotiations for
taking it on a long lease—ninety-nine years sort
of thing.”</p>

<p>Pillar looked at him. Ninety-nine years! He
didn’t believe there were such things in Scotch
leases—but perhaps it was hardly worth discussing
that—the quality of the visitor was such
that Pillar judged him to be a law unto himself.</p>

<p>“Would—whoever the house is let to—allow
me, d’you think, to see over it? I must do it now
or never—I’ve come a long way from—” And
he mentioned that far-off island, the sound of
whose name was always in Diana’s heart if not
forever on her lips. She was passing through the
hall, heard the name, and went out—and found
herself face to face with the young man who for
months had prayed for her every night. That, of
course, she did not know. But she knew he must
know her father and mother.</p>

<p>“I was asking if you would be so kind as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
allow me to see the Lodge.” She was far more
adorable than he had imagined and that he had
not deemed possible.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she answered; “do come in”—and
he went in, following his dream of dreams
come true.</p>

<p>“This is the hall,” she said; “it’s small, but it’s
quite big enough for wet mackintoshes—and—”</p>

<p>“I like it,” said Hastings, looking at her.</p>

<p>“So do I—this is the dining-room.” She
opened a door and motioned him to go in. He went
in and said it was delicious—still looking at her.</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t think it so delicious in England,
I suppose. I’ve never sat on horsehair in England.”</p>

<p>“Rather slippery, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“This is what we call the living-room—”
Opening another door; “your wife would perhaps
call it the drawing-room—you <em>are</em> married?”</p>

<p>“No—but why should you say my wife would
call it that?”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Because—why shouldn’t she call it what you
do?”</p>

<p>“Don’t get stuffy about it—I didn’t mean to
say anything against your wife.”</p>

<p>“But you did—and it’s a thing no man should
stand—you said she would do what you wouldn’t
do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t she?”</p>

<p>“Because I wouldn’t allow it—”</p>

<p>At that Diana laughed so much that Uncle Marcus
came to see what she was laughing at. Had she
had a letter from Elsie?—forgetting this was not
post-time—and he saw to his great amazement
a long-legged, very nice-looking young man (the
right sort of young man) sitting quite close to
Diana and laughing just as much as Diana was
laughing and apparently with as little reason.</p>

<p>“My dear Diana—” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, here’s some one to see the house and we’re
fighting about his wife.”</p>

<p>“<em>Wife?</em>” A smile broke upon the lips of Marcus—thank
goodness, this man was married.</p>

<p>“And he hasn’t got one,” said Diana.</p>

<p>“Not got one?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said Hastings; “the fact of the matter
is—I am just back from abroad. Perhaps I
should tell you at once that I am Miles Hastings,
one of Sir Eustace Carston’s A.D.C.’s—and—”</p>

<p>Of course Marcus vowed it was the most extraordinary
thing that had ever happened! Of course, he
must stay with them. His luggage should be sent
for. Marcus pulled the bell-rope and it came down.
Diana said it always did, and she went to call Pillar.</p>

<p>“It’s too amazing you should have come by
chance,” said Marcus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>Hastings did not see why he should say he had
gone to Mr. Maitland’s house in London, and
asked his address, because it was such an easy
thing to guess—Mr. Maitland should have guessed
it. Lady Carston naturally had not known the
Scotch address, but she had given him the London
one. Neither did he feel bound to say that Sir
Eustace had shown no anxiety to give him even
the London one. He had wondered at it; now he
was beginning to understand, for no father possessed
of a daughter like Diana would wish to
encourage any man.</p>

<p>Miles Hastings did not suppose, of course, for
one moment, that Sir Eustace had thought him
rather more dangerous than most young men, and
was seeking to protect Diana against his fascination.
Nor could he have dared to imagine that
Lady Carston would have let the child take her
chance, believing it might be a happy chance. He
was happy enough as it was.</p>

<p>The following day he was happier still. He and
Diana were fishing on the loch. Away in the distance,
a speck on the face of the waters, were
Watkins and Pease in their boat, fishing too.</p>

<p>To be quite accurate, in Diana’s boat, John,
gillie, was fishing, while Donald, gillie, kept the
boat drifting: and it must drift until Miles Hastings,
in the bow, had told Diana, likewise in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
bow, all there was to tell of that far-off island,
from which he had come—to see her.</p>

<p>He had said everything any girl would wish to
hear said of her father. He had said nearly all he
had to say about her mother. He was now deep in
tropical undergrowth and vegetation. It was wonderful
the number of plants he remembered in
their infinite variety—tree ferns—trees, ferns,
and flowers. Diana listened—she had never before
found ferns interesting.</p>

<p>Marcus waved from his boat, but no one saw
him. So he went home and sent Elsie two brace
of grouse. It was a message he wanted to send
more than the grouse and he dipped his pen in
vinegar and wrote, “Diana is very happy surrounded
with admirers.”</p>

<p>Elsie ate the grouse, sharing them with others,
dipped her pen in gall, and wrote back: “Of
course she is. She always is, but this surely is <em>the</em>
one—what do you think?”</p>

<p>What did Marcus think? A thousand things,
miserable things—jealous things, unreasoning
things, and, above all, he thought: “How did she
know? Had Diana confided in her and not in him?”</p>

<p>He took Elsie’s letter out on to the river’s side
to read again, to make certain of what lay behind
her words.</p>

<p>While he was reading it he gave Sandy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
rod, and Sandy was grateful to the man who had
written a letter (surely a woman it must have
been) that took three distinct readings to its
proper digestion. If a man were a true Christian—and
all fishermen should be that, for the earliest
of all Christians were fishermen before anything
else—he would give the rod oftener to the gillie
who stands beside him, knowing himself to be by
far the better fisherman of the two. For hours he
stands there with that certain knowledge biting
into his heart.</p>

<p>If Marcus had told Sandy all that lay in his
heart, Sandy would have been profoundly interested,
no doubt, because he had had cause,
in his time, to think of women as interfering
creatures—and of small use in a world of God-fearing
men. There were exceptions, he would
have allowed, and he would have instanced the
one now driving along the road behind them.</p>

<p>“Yon’s Mrs. Scott,” he said to Marcus.</p>

<p>“Where?” And Marcus’s eyes, following the
direction of Sandy’s finger, saw a lady driving
two ponies in a low phaeton. She pulled up the
ponies and, getting out of the carriage, came over
the heather towards Marcus. Marcus again handed
the rod to Sandy and went to meet Mrs. Scott:
Sandy would not have minded if Mr. Maitland
had gone to Heaven—just for a wee bittie, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
he, Sandy, fished the pool as it should be fished—on
earth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott was a gentle, mild, little woman and
she looked much happier in the heather she loved
than she had looked in the ballroom, in London,
she had not loved. And the tweed hat, pulled down
over her eyes, was infinitely more becoming to her
than the tiara had been.</p>

<p>“Any luck?” she asked.</p>

<p>“None. Sandy thinks I’m a poor fisherman.”</p>

<p>She smiled: Sandy possibly was right, but that
shouldn’t count against Mr. Maitland as a man.</p>

<p>It was then Mrs. Scott said how kind Marcus
had been in subscribing so generously to the cottage
hospital, and Marcus said: “Not at all.”</p>

<p>“I was so glad,” went on Mrs. Scott, “to see
your niece at the Sale—it was so good of her to
come. I remember her so well at the dance that
night—you remember?”</p>

<p>Marcus remembered more than he wanted her
to remember. Did she remember that he had told
her she was beautiful? It was a thing, he feared, no
plain woman would be likely to forget.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott sat down, arranged the heather
round her, dug the heels of her square-toed brogues
into its roots, and began:</p>

<p>“Now tell me about her! That night she seemed
imprisoned sunshine—is she in love?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>Marcus looked at her honest little brogues; then
at her clear eyes, but even they could not reassure
him. “D’you know her aunt, on the other side?”
This to make sure.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott said she did not. “On the other side?
Which side are you? Her mother’s, of course, how
stupid I am! Is the aunt very charming?”</p>

<p>Marcus said he hardly knew her, and felt this
restraint on his part to be magnanimous.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott smiled. “It’s so nice not to have to
know relations on the other side, isn’t it? Sometimes
they expect to be kissed—oh, I mean,
women expect women relations on the other
side—”</p>

<p>Marcus hastened to say he quite understood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott went on. “I was so sorry to miss
your niece when I called. You can imagine how
busy one is when one first comes back here. There
are all the dear old people to see. I admired your
niece so much that night—I was homesick for the
breeze on the moor—for the views of hills in the
distance—for—well, just for this dear country
of mine and your niece seemed to open the door to
its soft west wind.”</p>

<p>Marcus was very happy.</p>

<p>“I really want to tell you Ralph St. Jermyn
arrives to-morrow. You know why I expect you
to be interested? I have not forgotten how interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
he seemed that night. Does she care, do you
think?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell whether my niece cares for any
one or not—there are several.”</p>

<p>“Of course there must be, but Ralph is so—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but she must do as she wishes—”</p>

<p>“Of course—I only thought—perhaps, hoped—I
was very sleepy that night. I forget much of
what happened.”</p>

<p>Marcus was relieved to hear it.</p>

<p>“You were very kind to me, I remember. I am
so insignificant in a ballroom, I generally go to
sleep: but people are very kind; some one always
tells me when it’s time to wake up—but here I
count and I like it. I am thankful to be noticed by
any one in London, but here people are bound to
notice me,”—and the little woman laughed. “I
stand out. The biggest gillie runs to do my bidding,
and I love them all—gillies, women, children;
lairds too—all of them; and my one hope
is that my Sheila may meet some good man soon
and marry him at once, so that I may never have
to go to London again. Will you tell your niece
how kind she was the other day at the bazaar?
But she ran away too soon. I am afraid these
things bore young people, although my party were
very long-suffering—I am a fearful ogre, I fear.”</p>

<p>Marcus turned and looked at her: a little speck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
of kind humanity she seemed in a vast sea of
heather. At her feet, heather; behind her, heather;
before her, the rushing river; above her, the blue
sky; encircling her on all sides, hills, hills, hills.</p>

<p>“It’s good to be alive—it’s a good world,” she
said, but Marcus was not so sure that it was. His
days were spent without Diana, and his evenings
with Pease and Watkins; while Hastings talked
to Diana about her father. It was quite impossible,
he knew, that there should be so much to say about
any one man, and now to add to it all another man
was coming who would also talk to Diana—of
many things.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Ralph St. Jermyn had arrived at the
Scotts’ there were assembled, within reasonable
distance, what Aunt Elsie would have
called all Diana’s admirers, and Marcus, having
expressed a wish to see them all together, so that
he might judge of them, Diana set about to make
plans so that he might have the opportunity he
sought.</p>

<p>Her mind being full of islands, having heard
much of one from Miles Hastings, she bethought
herself of a bird-island that lay out to sea at some
distance from the end of the Loch, and on that
island she proposed Uncle Marcus and the other
men should spend some time together. Marcus
was perfectly willing. He was interested in sea-birds
and loved the sea; moreover, he was always
anxious to do anything Diana asked him to do,
in the hope, perhaps, that Aunt Elsie would have
proved in like circumstances less amenable. There
was always that incentive to an extreme amiability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Marcus said he would ask St. Jermyn to
join them and stay the night; but Diana must
understand it was late in the season for young
birds to be hatched. It was very unlikely there
would be any. Diana didn’t mind that—a bird
was a bird, no matter its age. She had a good deal
to say to Miles Hastings on the subject of islands.
She dwelt on them particularly at those times
when he wanted to talk of other things—emphasizing
rather persistently, he thought, the
fact that whereas one man on an island was as
helpless as a new-born babe, another was useful,
resourceful, and undefeated. He said he understood:
Uncle Marcus would be rather useless, St.
Jermyn more so. “But you,” said Diana, “would
make soup out of birds’ nests?”</p>

<p>He questioned it, but she persisted and went so
far as to predict that he would serve it up in the
half of a cocoanut shell, to which he readily agreed,
such things being usually found on the islands of
Scotland.</p>

<p>“Wait and see,” she said.</p>

<p>He was waiting as it was, and growing daily
more and more hopeless; just as surely as Diana
was growing more and more delightful, and, of
course, more and more beautiful. Any girl may do
that, is bound to do it, in the eyes at least of the
man who loves her. With Mr. Maitland, Hastings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
felt he made no progress. He was polite, as a host
is almost in duty bound to be, but he never talked
about Diana as Hastings would have liked him to
talk: never left them alone together, as Hastings
would have liked to be left. He very often, on the
contrary, prevented them being alone and Diana
unfortunately did not seem to notice it. Hastings
wondered in what way he might propitiate his
host. He might save him from drowning, but it
was hardly likely Mr. Maitland would place himself
in that particular danger, thereby affording
Hastings the opportunity he so earnestly sought.
He might save Diana from drowning, but even to
benefit himself he would not let her risk that peril
by water.</p>

<p>The island, on which Diana proposed Uncle
Marcus and the young men should be stranded for
a while, rose straight from the sea: a barren rock.
It would take three quarters of an hour to get
there in the motor launch, and given a fine day it
should prove a delightful expedition—“For those
who like it,” said Watkins mournfully.</p>

<p>Diana undertook to make all the arrangements.
She and John discussed the matter at length, and
John would have been seen—if any one had
looked—to shake his head every now and then
during the discussion, and to raise a protesting
hand; but protest as he would, Diana triumphed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
and her word was law—just as her will was his
pleasure, which John was most careful to say when
it was most evident her will was <em>not</em> his pleasure.</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus had suggested taking lunch with
them, but Diana objected. She said they would get
frightfully tired of the island, and as soon as they
had seen what birds there might be just out of
the shell, and what birds there might be not quite
out of the shell, they would long to go home.
Again Diana had her way.</p>

<p>They landed on the island: Diana climbing up
ahead of them all and calling first to one, then to
another to come and look here—and there. She
pointed out evidence of original sin as presented
by the sight of a little bird still attached to its
shell, who was ready to fight for the rocky inheritance
that was his by at least the right of priority.
The men were interested. Everything in the nature
of uncultivated land, be it rock or otherwise, suggested
interesting problems to St. Jermyn, and
at his fingers’ ends he had statistics as to how
many herrings were eaten per day per gull. That
opened up the “Fisheries” question, an important
one.</p>

<p>Marcus was perfectly ready to discuss any
question with St. Jermyn; but he wanted first of
all to take a photograph of a particular gull, who
at all events up to this moment had not deprived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
the poor man of a single herring. “Just wait,” he
said, “one moment!”</p>

<p>Marcus found St. Jermyn very interesting: and
exactly the kind of man he would like Diana
to marry if she must marry, but he did not see
the necessity. Hastings, too, was, of course, very
attractive, for even to Marcus a certain length
of limb and an amazing amount of virility in a
young man were attractive. As to many middle-aged
men youth strongly appealed to him, and it
was only because of Diana that he made the smallest
attempt to withstand Hastings. Having only
just discovered her, as it were, he did not see why
he should give her up to the first man who happened
to fall in love with her.</p>

<p>When all the men were deeply engaged with the
birds on the island, Diana took the opportunity
to slip away, back to the landing-place where
John awaited her orders. “Now, John,” she said;
and John drew from his capacious pockets various
things, among them a flask, a bottle, and a parcel.
“Just inside the cave, John, there!” Diana pointed
to the cave, and John climbed up the rock and put
the things inside the cave. Diana followed him,
and at the mouth of the cave she built a cairn of
stones, and under the top stone she placed a slip of
paper; then telling John to be quick she left the
place as quickly as she had come and sliding down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
the rock called to him to slide softly: but John was
heavier than Diana and slid less gracefully, and
little stones came rattling down with him.</p>

<p>“They’ll no be hearin’ them,” said John.</p>

<p>Diana dropped into the boat where Tooke was
biding his time, and hers. She told him to slip off
quietly, and he assured her that what noise the
boat would make would be drowned by the sound
of the wind which was rising. John screwed up his
eyes, looked out to sea, and predicted a “storrrm.”
Diana was afraid they might not escape unseen,
and she looked anxiously to the quickly receding
island; but John said the gentlemen would be so
busy in taking the little birds that they would not
be looking.</p>

<p>“Not taking them, John; that would be horribly
cruel!”</p>

<p>“Just their photograph-ees, miss,” said John.</p>

<p>He went on to say he had been one day fishing
on the loch with a gentleman, and as they had
passed an island on the loch they had seen three
wee birds just out of the shell, and when they
came back five hours later and passed the island
the wee birds had swum out to meet them. “And,
indeed, they did and the gentleman took them.”</p>

<p>“Not the birds, John,” protested Diana again
for the sake of his reassurance, “just their photograph-ees,”
and Diana thought of Uncle Marcus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
who was also just taking photograph-ees of little
birds, and her eyes danced and she saw nothing of
the storm that was coming.</p>

<p>She got home and ate a most excellent luncheon
cooked in Mrs. Oven’s best manner, and having
drunk her coffee sat down to write a letter, and
the letter she wrote was this:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Aunt Elsie</span>,—I am all alone. It’s
really rather nice. I think it’s a little tiring being
so much with men. They are so exacting, don’t
you think so? However, to-day they have left me
alone and I don’t feel deserted or in the least unhappy,
but I should love to see you, if only for a
minute. I don’t know why, but I feel I should like
to have some one to laugh with. You are such a
splendid laugher. Uncle Marcus has gone on a
kind of a scientific expedition. He wants very
much to take what John calls photograph-ees of
sea-birds on their nests, and he has taken all the
men with him.</p>

<p>I suppose there is no better way of judging of a
man’s character than to be stranded with him on
a desert island. I can imagine that, if by any
chance, Uncle Marcus and party were stranded
there, Mr. Watkins would read his poetry to him.
Wouldn’t the Marky man love it? Mr. Pease?
What would he do? Tell him stories of his life as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
child?—his lonely childhood? Mr. St. Jermyn, I
imagine, would leave him severely alone; would go
to the farthest part of the island and would gently
curse in an unparliamentary manner. What do you
think, my aunt? And Captain Hastings, what
would he do? I think and believe he would cook
a delicious dinner and feed Uncle Marcus, give
him soup in cocoanut shells and seaweed fritters,
and fried eggs—gulls’ eggs. We shall see—should
see, I mean.</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus is frightfully pleased with life. Of
course, the shooting is not what he expected and
the river is low, but he is very much softened by
his stay in the Highlands, and yesterday he hoped
you were quite well: and he wondered if you
minded living in a relaxing part of the world;
which, by the way, you don’t do. But I didn’t
say so because it seems to make him more of a
happy Christian to think you do. Pillar is delightful
here. He shot a grey-hen the other day, a very
bad sin, and when he was reprimanded, he expressed
contrition, but added: “It was very encouraging,
sir.” I suppose it is when you don’t
shoot much. Uncle Marcus forgets that a man,
though poor and lowly, may be a sportsman. I
want him to give the gillies a day on the moor;
and I want Uncle Marcus and all my young men
to act as gillies. The boat will be going to fetch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
Uncle Marcus in a minute, so I must stop. I hope
you aren’t very lonely. I wish you were here!</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="padding-right: 4em">Your loving</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Diana</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>Then she walked to the window and looked out.
It was raining, not heavily; but a fine, driving mist
blotted out the landscape. The island would be
rather a horrible place now—rather horrible! She
became grave; she no longer wanted Aunt Elsie
because she was a splendid laugher, but rather
because she was one to quiet fears, to make things
look brighter than they really were. Could any
aunt in the world do that now? No glimmer of
light pierced the grey pall that hung over the
Lodge of Glenbossie.</p>

<p>Diana went to the door and called John, and
out of the mist stepped John, and Sandy with
him. Beads of moisture stood all over their rough
tweed coats and they looked as serious as they
looked moist. They said: “What aboot the gentlemen,
now?” and Diana asked, “What about
them?”</p>

<p>And Sandy looked to John and John shook his
head and was thinking the sea would be too rough:
there would be no fetching them now. And Sandy
nodded. John was right there.</p>

<p>“Not to-day?” asked Diana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>John doubted it: Sandy doubted it. Diana began
to doubt it.</p>

<p>The moor was no longer visible. The birch wood
was blotted out.</p>

<p>“Tooke must try, Sandy—John! He must!
Make him!”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said the two men, and like Shetland
ponies they turned their backs to the storm.</p>

<p>“What did we leave on the island? Enough
whiskey for them all?”</p>

<p>John shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not enough?” asked Diana incredulously.
“There was a whole flask.”</p>

<p>“And there are five gentlemen to it,” said John,
and he shook his head.</p>

<p>“But five men couldn’t drink a flask of whiskey
in one day, it’s such disgusting stuff!” said Diana.</p>

<p>And John looked to Sandy and Sandy to John.
It took a good joke to make Sandy laugh—he
laughed the noo!</p>

<p>“We left a lobster—and a tin of sardines,
didn’t we, John?” said Diana anxiously.</p>

<p>John would not be saying that much whatever.</p>

<p>“And a match?”</p>

<p>“A match, yes.” John admitted that.</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>He said they had thought that enough, for the
matter of an hour or two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“Some tobacco, John?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some tobacco.”</p>

<p>One match, some tobacco, a tin of sardines, a
lobster, a flask of whiskey, a bottle of water, and
two empty cocoanut shells and—five men.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Marcus Maitland peering into his camera hoped
he hadn’t taken two photographs on one film, and
Hastings was quite certain he had not. Why that
certain assurance should have been his was simply
evidence that it had been his duty in life to assure
his elders and betters that whatever their excellencies
had done, they had done well and that
nothing they did could be wrong. “Take another,”
he suggested, “to make sure.” And Marcus took
another. As he wound up the film he wondered
where his niece was. Hastings, of course, was wondering,
too, and hoping: “Not on the other side of
the island with St. Jermyn.” “I don’t know, sir,”
he said; “shall I go and find her?”</p>

<p>At the same moment Mr. Watkins came along.
He wanted, he said, to show Miss Carston something
really most interesting he had found. Every
one had something most interesting to show Miss
Carston, but she was not to be found. Marcus suggested
they should all look for her, she couldn’t be
far off. The island was small—but she herself was
not to be found, though all the men sought her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>Uncle Marcus thought she must be in the boat
and went to see, but he could find no boat. It was,
therefore, quite evident she had gone fishing. They
must wait till she came back; she must be back
soon. They waited.</p>

<p>A sea-bird island is not a very pleasant place to
be on for any length of time: moreover, there
was a storm getting up.</p>

<p>“Let us call for help!” said Pease. “Let us
shout!”</p>

<p>Watkins yodled. Ever since he had come north
he had been awaiting his chance to do it. He did it
again and again.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” said Marcus; “I can’t hear.”</p>

<p>Watkins, piqued, said there was nothing to hear.</p>

<p>“Listen!” entreated Marcus.</p>

<p>They listened. There was the screaming of birds
disturbed: the chippering of chicks alarmed; but
no sound of Diana’s voice, or anything like it.</p>

<p>“It looks stormy,” said Marcus, turning up the
collar of his coat.</p>

<p>“A bit choppy,” admitted Hastings.</p>

<p>“The mist rolls up—List to the sound of guns—buns—duns—puns—runs—”
said Watkins;
then he added wistfully, “It’s curious that
there is no rhyme to month.”</p>

<p>“Who wants one?” asked Pease.</p>

<p>“It’s not a question of wanting one, my dear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Pease; there is not one to be had. If I stay here a
month I cannot say so in a poem without great
difficulty, and probably—”</p>

<p>“There’s bunth, of course,” said Hastings, “but
perhaps he doesn’t count.” He lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Never heard of such a word.”</p>

<p>“No? He—or it if you prefer it—is a jolly
little beast, usually to be found in the tropics
under a leaf, and is something between a marmoset
and a beetle.” Hastings threw away the match
with which he had lighted his cigarette and Marcus
picked it up; he hated matches thrown about.</p>

<p>“A what?” asked Watkins, his pocket-book
ready and pencil poised.</p>

<p>“It’s no time for joking, Hastings,” said Marcus.
“A storm in this part of the world can get up in
a moment: we’re in for one now, unless I’m very
much mistaken and we may be here for hours.
What can have happened?”</p>

<p>“We are stranded on a desert island, that’s
quite clear,” said Hastings, and he remembered
Diana’s words. What had she said about desert
islands? She had rather harped on the subject. Was
she playing a practical joke? It looked like it. If
she had planned a ridiculous game he would play
it with her. If she had meant to be funny he would
laugh with her. He would enter into the spirit of
any joke she chose to perpetrate—be it good, bad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
or indifferent; and after all an island is an island,
and a man is a boy, and what man is there, who is
as much a boy as he ought to be, who can be on
an island and not light a fire? or be in a wood and
not look for birds’ nests? Being very much of a
man he was very much of a boy. Diana had spoken
in fun of desert islands. Did she realize how deeply
implanted in the heart of every real man is the
longing for the primordial life? Not for long, perhaps,
but to experience it, for once? Hastings had
dreamed all his life of a desert island. He had
cooked, he had built, he had slept, on a desert
island. He had lain awake under the stars above
it, slept, lulled by the wind that rocked it. He had
risen with the sun that rose behind it, and had
bathed in the noonday heat that scorched it.
Did Diana know the lure of those dreams? He set
out to explore and at the mouth of the cave he
came upon the cairn of her building. He took the
paper from under the top stone and he read of the
historical one match, with which she dared him to
light a fire! It required, she said, the very particular
skill of the experienced explorer to light a
fire with the last match. “I am sure you can do it,”
she wrote. Further she said she knew exactly how
a desert island should be furnished—there should,
by rights, of course, be a chest of drawers in the
cave. She knew how it should be stocked: with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
what cunning the stores should be hidden; they
should stand upon a rock in full view—but she
realized how little time there was to spare, how
soon Uncle Marcus would tire of a desert island;
so she had placed all he should need in a box, and
in that box he would find two halves of a cocoanut
shell, in which to make soup, and other things,
such as whiskey, that should help to keep Uncle
Marcus warm and happy for a little while—and
sardines that should sustain him. Hastings wished
Diana had thought of a funnier joke, but he had
vowed he would be amused. He would light the
fire; that at least would be good fun, and he would
stick faithfully to the one match. He would tell
her he had made soup and boiled eggs. He would
get Uncle Marcus to swear he had swallowed
them; he—Miles—should not be the loser in the
end: the joke should be his ... until such time as
it should find its way home again to her!</p>

<p>He went out of the cave to gather driftwood.
The storm had risen, he was caught by the scudding
rain and whipped by the wind. He wished she
would come. In a moment the rain was running
down his neck and oozing over the tops of his
shoes. The joke was beginning to pall, but he said
to himself, and truly, that if it had been any one
else’s it would have palled long before. He was
going back to the cave when he saw at his feet a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
little bird that looked about to die. “Poor little
beggar!” he said. “It’s a poor joke, isn’t it?”
And lifting it up he examined it, promising to do
what he could to save its funny little life. “You
would, would you?” he asked, as the little bird
pecked at his finger. “Wait a bit, my little friend,
until you are sitting by a warm fire with a speck of
whiskey inside you—eh? Come along!”</p>

<p>The joke was not such a bad one after all. A fire
has been lighted for worse things than for the
warming of a little half-dead bird. “You’re an
ugly little beggar—yes, you are!” he said. “Now
be quiet while I light a fire with one match—one
match, old man, is all that stands between you
and death—yes, death!”</p>

<p>To the little bird it must have been an enormous
giant that placed him so tenderly in a safe place,
under the shadow of a great rock. The little bird
watched with interest the arranging of that fire:
gasped when the one match nearly went out:
blinked when the flame fostered in the hollow of
a gigantic hand flared up straight and strong—and
yellow, the colour of its mother’s eyes—a
colour warm, comforting, and kind. The giant put
the flame to the driftwood; it caught here, went
out there, blazed up here; the little bird squeaked.
“Wait a bit, sonny—it’ll be all right. It’s no
joke dying when you’re so young, is it? I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
measles myself long ago—here—draw up to the
fire, closer—that’s right—now for a little whiskey.
Like it, old man? No, no more! True Scotsman
that you are—later on, perhaps! Now go to
sleep. I’ll go and see what the others are doing—squawk
if you’re frightened—I shan’t be far
off.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t such a bad joke after all. Bother the
rain!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marcus had taken all the photographs
he could take and began to find Diana’s
joke—if joke it were—a poor one—and a stupid
one. He made no vow to be amused by it—no
uncle would. Watkins, anxious to help, said the
only thing he could do to while away the time was
to recite and he cleared his throat.</p>

<p>“If you would shout instead, I should be very
much obliged,” said Marcus; “some one might
hear you.”</p>

<p>Shouting was not at all the same thing to Watkins
because it was a thing he did with great
difficulty. However, he must try and he should be
very glad if some one should chance to hear him
because his landlady never did, and she always
put the blame on his voice. He asked St. Jermyn
to shout too, and St. Jermyn shouted.</p>

<p>“You should be a fine singer,” said Watkins,
clearing his throat again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>“Think so?” asked St. Jermyn, indifferent to
praise.</p>

<p>“<em>I</em> do—indeed I do—don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>I</em> do, of course.”</p>

<p>“You? Oh, I see you are joking.”</p>

<p>“I never felt less like joking—d’you know
what a storm here can mean?”</p>

<p>“Not particularly here,” said Mr. Watkins.</p>

<p>“I thought not. Shout!”</p>

<p>Watkins shouted. Marcus stood in the fine
drizzling rain peering out to sea—and saw
nothing.</p>

<p>Again St. Jermyn shouted.</p>

<p>“Be quiet!” said Watkins; his ears, attuned to
the elements, he said, were the first to hear an
answering call. It was the hoot of a steamer—at
that moment of all sounds most blessed—even
the voice of Diana must have been less sweet.</p>

<p>“It’s a yacht,” said Marcus.</p>

<p>“The Scotts, I expect,” said Ralph St. Jermyn;
“I told them if they should be round here to look
us up.” (What a comfortable thing it is to have
cousins who have yachts! and other things, most
desirable.) “They will find difficulty in getting a
boat off—unless they can get under the lee of the
island,” he added.</p>

<p>Until that moment when Mrs. Scott held out
two hands to Marcus to greet him, he had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
been able to excuse his want of judgment in having
allowed himself to call her beautiful. He had always
felt he had risked his reputation in so doing—his
reputation as a judge of beauty. Now as he
took her hands in his he found her of all women
the most to be admired. There was something
after all that was better than beauty of line, there
was charm of expression, and she was, at this
moment, perhaps, even beautiful: but he could not
see because she wore a sou’wester well pulled down
over her eyes, but he could imagine the kindness
beaming from those eyes. The smile on her lips he
could see, so that if he did not stand completely
exonerated he at least must be largely excused—to
a cold, wet man all women may seem beautiful.</p>

<p>“You dear moist things,” she said, “how did
you get stranded here?”</p>

<p>A few minutes after they had left the island, and
Marcus was being ministered to by Mrs. Scott,
Miles Hastings came in search of him. He shouted;
but there was no answer except the screeching of
birds as they flew up in their thousands at his
approach. There was no sign of man. Was this
another joke?—this time a poor one—a very
poor one? It had not been Diana’s fault that the
day had turned out wet; but this was childish. He
walked on and shouted again. There was still no
answer. The waves hurled themselves against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
rocks, making a noise like the booming of guns—old
Watkins had said that. It was quite evident
that by some miraculous chance the others had
got off the island, and had forgotten him. He wondered
that St. Jermyn had forgotten him: perhaps
he had not—that was another way of looking
at it!</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done so he went back
to the cave, where he found that the little bird, at
all events, had not forgotten him. “What shall we
do?” he asked, and the little bird said nothing—how
should he know when he had lived so short a
time—and knew nothing as yet of the division of
days? Breakfast, lunch, dinner, were to him as
one. He would have no divisions between them—if
he had the ordering of things.</p>

<p>There was one thing Hastings could always do,
and that anywhere, no matter where—think of
Diana! He pulled up the collar of his coat closer
round his ears, sat down in the best shelter he
could find, picked up the little bird, told it to be
good, and proceeded to think of Diana. If she had
forgotten him the situation was about as bad as it
could be, but he was convinced something must
have happened—a thousand things might have
happened. The motor launch might have gone
wrong—if it had, then she might be in danger.
He sprang up to look. “All right, old chap, I won’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
drop you.” He looked first one way, then another,
and in neither direction could he see anything. A
veil impenetrable hung between him and the mainland.
The storm raged—more and more furiously.
He knew it must spend itself in time, it was bound
to. Diana at that moment was wondering what he
was doing?</p>

<p>She could never have guessed that he was
greatly exercised over the feeding of his young
charge with bits of sardine—meant for Marcus.
That done he was going to think about her. That
he would think about her she might have guessed—but
she could hardly have guessed how tenderly
he was going to do it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Down</span> on the shore of the loch Diana waited,
buffeted by the wind, drenched by the rain.
Her hair loosened by the wind blew into her eyes.
She pushed it back impatiently: she was waiting
for the storm to clear. So soon as the clouds
broke, and she saw light on the horizon, and the
waters were stilled, she would send the launch for
Uncle Marcus. That he must by this time be
suffering from congestion of the lungs, she was
gloomily certain. There was now no question as
to which of the men she loved; she loved them all,
in the sense, at least, that there was not one of
them she wouldn’t marry to save him from
drowning, or from pneumonia. Not one! She had
only meant to be funny and she had not been
funny. A poor joke was a crime in itself—nothing
excused it. If it had been a good joke they would
all have forgiven her, but what with the rain and
the wind and the island—horrible at all times—she
had sinned beyond forgiveness. Oh, to be with
Aunt Elsie—the peace of it—the perfect peace!
The memory of the sun-steeped garden, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
booming of bees—so different from the booming
of waves—of the scent of the roses, was more
than she could bear—and the deliciousness of
Shan’t became an aching memory.</p>

<p>Pillar was watching, too, clad in oilskins and
wearing a sou’wester. He made the agony still
more acute, by carrying a rope. As Napoleon is
pictured standing wrapt in melancholy, so stood
Pillar—awaiting the worst.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stiffened and came towards her,
as though, she thought, he were in London, about
to announce a visitor. “Mr. St. Jermyn, miss,” he
said. She had been right, he was a butler again
announcing a visitor, and never was visitor so
welcome as this one.</p>

<p>“You!” she cried, as St. Jermyn came towards
her across the sandy bay and took her hands in his.</p>

<p>“I am abjectly sorry,” she said, and withdrew
them gently, explaining they were wet. Then she
asked him if he had forgiven her, which was a
dangerous question to ask.</p>

<p>“Yes ... now,” he said, with a still more dangerous
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Why now?” she asked—a foolish question to
ask. She might have guessed why.</p>

<p>“Don’t spoil it,” he said gently.</p>

<p>“I only meant it as a joke—leaving you on the
island, I mean. And then, when I got back and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
going to send the launch to fetch you, the storm
had got up and the men said the sea was too
rough.”</p>

<p>“Why did you leave us?”</p>

<p>“As a joke! I told you.” It was awful to have to
go on explaining that the idiotic thing she had
done was a joke.</p>

<p>“For no other reason?”</p>

<p>“I was tired of so many men, that was all!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t put up with one, I suppose, who
is very humble and doesn’t ask much?”</p>

<p>“No—at the moment I want you all—tell me,
how did you get off the island?”</p>

<p>“The Scotts picked us up. They were out fishing
or had been before the storm got up. There was a
little difficulty in sending out the boat for us, but
they managed it—they got under the lee of the
island. Your uncle is anxious about you—he is
afraid you are wet—you are!” St. Jermyn put
his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>She moved away. “Not really wet,” she said;
“a little damp, but what does it matter how wet
I am now you are all back.”</p>

<p>“We are not all back. Hastings is still on the
island.”</p>

<p>The wind and rain had stung Diana’s cheeks to
a vivid colour and she wore a blue hood drawn
over her hair and wore it as St. Jermyn had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
thought only an Irishwoman could wear it. He
found her distractingly pretty.</p>

<p>“Still on the island? He must be frightfully wet,”
she said.</p>

<p>“And very hungry,” he added.</p>

<p>“Oh—yes, perhaps—” Hunger she knew
would not be the worst thing he had to bear. “But
some one must fetch him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, some one must fetch him. We forgot him,
which is a thing I should not have thought I could
possibly have done, whatever the others might do.
The storm may clear off at any moment. They do
in these parts as suddenly as they come up.”</p>

<p>“But if it doesn’t clear up?”</p>

<p>St. Jermyn looked at her—then out to sea and
back again to her.</p>

<p>“If you want him to be fetched I will fetch him—for
<em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“Why for me?”</p>

<p>“Because you want some one to go and I want
to please you—is that reason enough?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that if I didn’t want him fetched
you wouldn’t go?”</p>

<p>“I mean that. I would let some one else go.”</p>

<p>“Why not let some one else go now, then? A
man on an island must be fetched. Why should
you make it a personal thing?”</p>

<p>“Because I want everything between you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
me to be personal. I want my chance, that’s all.
You say a man on an island must be fetched. Do
you realize that for me to do it is an act of heroism?
Supposing it would suit me that Hastings should
stay forever on the island, what then? Suppose
that in fetching him off the island I know I destroy
my one chance of happiness, and I still fetch him—for
your sake—what does that argue?”</p>

<p>“I can’t argue—I hate it. He is cold and wet—he
is cold and wet because I behaved like an idiot—he
must be fetched.”</p>

<p>“Many a time during the last few days I have
wished to drown him.”</p>

<p>Diana said she didn’t believe him, but he assured
her it was true. “Just as heartily as he has
wished to drown me,” he added.</p>

<p>That Diana refused to believe.</p>

<p>“No? Well, then, his position is evidently more
assured than I imagined it, and he is a more fortunate
man than I am—he can afford to be magnanimous.
Well, I am going to fetch him for your
sake—you can’t rob me of that nobility of character—I
shall fetch him in order to make you
happy—just as I would do anything else in the
world to make you happy. It will make you
happy—I should like to be certain of that—before—”</p>

<p>Diana said of course it would make her happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
that any one cold and miserable should be made
warm and happy, “But I don’t want you to run
any danger—that I wouldn’t face myself. I will
come with you.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” The thought of an hour—or as
long as he liked to make it—alone with Diana
was a delirious thought—less delirious was the
thought of the return journey with Hastings in the
boat. Hastings with the glamour of martyrdom
upon him would be invulnerable. St. Jermyn said
he wasn’t sure that Hastings would like that, and
Diana asked why? He would be glad to see her,
she knew.</p>

<p>“Without me—yes, but with me? What do
you think?”</p>

<p>“Why should he mind?” she asked; then added,
“It will be safe for you to go, though?”</p>

<p>If it were not would she mind? he asked her.</p>

<p>She answered, of course, why not? If she had
proved herself devoid of humour, it did not show
she was heartless.</p>

<p>“I wish I understood you—perhaps if I did I
should be even less happy than I am. It’s clearing,
I’ll go; any message for him?”</p>

<p>She shook her head—then said: “My humble
duty, perhaps—”</p>

<p>“I am glad you did not ask me to take him your
love because I should have kept half for myself—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
if you would trust it all to me—to give what
I like of it to Hastings—”</p>

<p>Diana, interrupting him, said she was tired of
jokes. So was he, he vowed: he was in deadly
earnest. “By the way—if in earnest I asked you—‘Will
you marry me?’ What should you say?”</p>

<p>“I should say—‘Is this a serious proposal?’”</p>

<p>“And if I said ‘Yes’—what should you say
then?”</p>

<p>“I should say, it was too windy to hear—too
wet to answer—too cold to marry.”</p>

<p>“Too cold—that’s it! Isn’t it? Why are you
so cold?”</p>

<p>“The wind—I can’t hear—I told you!”</p>

<p>“I am very serious—it’s no joke—”</p>

<p>Diana looked at him. “Are you really serious?”
she asked.</p>

<p>He said he was very serious.</p>

<p>“Then I, too, am very serious. I should say I
was very sorry, but I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“Would you say why?”</p>

<p>“I should say it had nothing to do with the
weather—the wind or the rain—but just to do
with my heart.”</p>

<p>“You would mean that seriously?”</p>

<p>“I should mean it very seriously.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall not propose.”</p>

<p>“It would be a careless thing to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span></p>

<p>She went into the Lodge, very unhappy, very
wet, and very much perturbed. She had a bath,
dressed for dinner, and went downstairs to meet
Uncle Marcus. Uncle Marcus was clean and dry
and dressed for dinner. And he was very serious.
Not at all a nice Uncle Marcus: but Diana was
quick to see the justice of this. There was no
reason he should be nice.</p>

<p>“You were extremely foolish,” he said, “and
Hastings is still on the island.” He didn’t look up
from the “Scotsman” he was reading. Diana said
Mr. St. Jermyn had gone to fetch him.</p>

<p>“Why St. Jermyn, when there are plenty of
men about?”</p>

<p>“He went to please me,” said Diana, sitting
down on the table—an attitude of hers Uncle
Marcus particularly disliked.</p>

<p>“Because he is in love with you he goes to fetch
another man who is also in love with you. You
will find it difficult to choose between them. You
are under an obligation to one and you have—”</p>

<p>“Captain Hastings would never retaliate.”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me to help you, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Elsie will help me.”</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus put down the “Scotsman.” Diana
had taken his middle stump with a fast underhand
ball—so he would have described it.</p>

<p>“My dear child,” he said, “don’t do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
rash—it’s all perfectly simple. What has happened
to you has happened to most women—girls—I
expect—attractive girls, I mean. You
are, I am sure, in no way to blame....”</p>

<p>“Let me get on to the sofa, darling,” said Diana;
“there, that’s right, now go on.”</p>

<p>“What was I saying?” resumed Uncle Marcus.
“You are in no way to blame—”</p>

<p>“I am kissing my hand to you hard,” said Diana,
from the depths of the sofa.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t interrupt me. I was saying, you
are in no way to blame. Men must take their
chances. It happens that two men are in love with
you—two at least—both are excellent young
men. It is perhaps difficult for you to choose between
them, for in your inexperience you possibly
hardly realize what it is you want—what kind
of life would most appeal to you—let me help
you! St. Jermyn is heir to large estates—he is
going into Parliament. I am told he will make a
name. He speaks well—has something to say—and
says it clearly. Hastings, as A.D.C. to your
father, has seen life from a different point of view.
He has walked too much, perhaps, on red carpet—has
seen the world too much, perhaps, from the
Government House point of view; but he has
plenty of brains and is no doubt older than he
looks. His boyish manner makes him seem younger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
than he is. He was telling me something of his
prospects last night when St. Jermyn interrupted
us. It seems he will have a certain amount if not
very much—but as I have told you, I am perfectly
willing to help you to marry the man you
really love. He undoubtedly has high ideals and
a great reverence for women—so, for the matter
of that, has St. Jermyn, very markedly so. Of
course—”</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus, touched by the depth of his own
understanding, turned to look at Diana—she was
fast asleep.</p>

<p>And while she slept Hastings on the island was
thinking of her. He had first heard of her, loved
to hear of her: he had fallen in love with her because
of the look in her mother’s eyes when she
spoke of her, because of the way her father smiled
when he thought of her.</p>

<p>Lady Carston had never exactly described her—had
never said how extraordinarily beautiful her
eyes were—had never said anything about the
colour of her hair—had never said that she looked
like a lovely boy (which, of course, she did)—had
never really said anything. It was the way
she had said “My Diana” that had been so wonderful—it
was as if she had taken a child up in
her arms and kissed her—“My Diana!” “Mine,
too,” said Hastings. The little gull squawked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
him—a belligerent little devil he was—“Yes,
mine,” said Hastings, “and in the days to come—don’t
you forget it!”</p>

<p>No, Lady Carston hadn’t said much, considering
all the things she might have said. Then the
photograph. He had found it lying about. He
had thought it a pity it should get lost—Hastings
here felt in his pocket—it was all right. Then he
had seen her only a short time ago for the first
time—it seemed in some ways years ago—and
she was more than he had ever thought she could be—more
adorable, more beautiful. He had much to
think about. He didn’t care how much it rained—he
would have been happier, of course, if St.
Jermyn had been on the island too: he had never
so earnestly desired his presence: but it was no
good worrying. Back to Diana! He had much to
think about—how she looked at breakfast—at
shooting-lunches—walking—fishing! He could
see her in tweeds—in chiffons—with her hat on—without
it. He could picture her—dared to
picture her—a solemn moment this (in the booming
of the waves breaking on the rocks he could
hear church bells—in the wind the swelling of an
organ) in her wedding-dress! A rather wonderful
sight—dear old Marcus giving her away—no,
Sir Eustace stepped forward here—Lady Carston,
too, looking splendid, of course—with the “Diana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
look” in her eyes. Wait a bit, though—out of the
mist came a small woman, a little less beautiful
than Lady Carston—perhaps because as yet she
lacked the “Diana look” in her eyes. She had another
look in her eyes, though—a more familiar
look. She became clearer, clearer than all the rest.
Sir Eustace stepped back, then Lady Carston
made way—his mother remained—and Diana;
and his mother took Diana in her arms—and her
eyes had the “Diana look” after all. His mother!
“Be quiet, my son,”—this to the little bird.</p>

<p>Back went his thoughts to the years when he
had not known Diana. Yet it must have been of
Diana he and his mother had so often talked. He
remembered particularly one evening when they
had sat over the fire at home and she had spoken
to him of things of which she said she would not
have spoken if he had had a father to do it; and
he remembered saying that no father could have
said so wonderfully what she had said. Yes, of
course; if it was not actually of Diana his mother
had spoken, it was because of the Diana who
should some day be his—he saw that now! Wonderful
people—mothers! Back to Diana herself—he
had skipped some years in his thoughts. Distance
sets no limit to our thinking—he and Diana
had been married some time—there was a question
of her going or not going to a ball. (A Viceroy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
and A.D.C. here floated across the misty picture.)
She had gone to a ball. It was their first difference—it
could not be described as a quarrel. In the
small hours of the morning she had come back, and
into his room. He was pretending he had been
asleep! The diamonds glittered on her arms, round
her neck, in her hair. He didn’t pause to consider
where the diamonds had come from. In novels,
from which he had borrowed his experiences of
these things, the diamonds were always treated
as a matter of course. They were stage properties.
Diana was lovely in her defiance. She had enjoyed
herself immensely!—Yes—she had danced with
Captain M ... slim—delicious thing that she
was!</p>

<p>Then came the delicate scene. Hastings changed
his position—disturbing the gulls, who had grown
accustomed to trust him: he didn’t see them, did
not know he had abused that trust! It required all
the gentleness there was in his strong nature to
forgive Diana as beautifully as he meant to forgive
her—all the tenderness he was possessed of must
go to show her where in her innocence she had
erred in judgment—</p>

<p>“Bored stiff, old chap?” asked St. Jermyn.</p>

<p>“How in the world did you get here? I thought
you had gone,” said Hastings, roused from his
day-dream: robbed of his best scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>“Diana asked me to fetch you.”</p>

<p>“Mind the little bird,” said Hastings sharply.
“Look out where you’re going!”</p>

<p>St. Jermyn had chosen a weapon at random with
which to fight Hastings, but he had not thought
to deal him so deadly a blow. He had dealt it in a
moment of temper, resenting the way Hastings
had spoken to him when he had come at great
personal discomfort across a choppy sea to rescue
him. He would put it right later: in the mean time
Hastings deserved it whatever discomfort he suffered
from the wound. By dinner-time St. Jermyn
had forgotten he had called Diana anything but
Miss Carston, and looked upon her as something
beautiful and desirable, but out of his reach. If it
became expedient for him to worship at some other
shrine, he would think of her forever with reverence
and gratitude. What did it matter what he called
her? He knew she would never respond. To Miles
Hastings it mattered enormously what St. Jermyn
called her.</p>

<p>But to Ralph St. Jermyn his career mattered
more than the name of any woman; it had become
as a god to him. Whatever happened nothing must
interfere with that. He owed it to himself—so he
said—to succeed. His affection for Diana had been
very sincere—politically so, at all events. It was
as a politician—a successful politician—he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
imagined himself married to her. On first seeing
her sitting at the head of her uncle’s dinner-table
in London, he had thought how delightful she
would look in days to come, seated at the head of
his. He went further still and saw her in Downing
Street—a graceful, beautiful, and satisfying vision,
standing at the top of the staircase, for choice. She
had a way of talking to every one and any one that
was particularly attractive, and to a Member of
Parliament—although only a prospective one—more
than attractive. She would be, as his wife, a
valuable asset. There was no one who seemed too
old to interest her: no one too young. She could
talk to a man of those things in which he was particularly
interested, yet was quick to see if they
were just the things he at that moment most
earnestly wished to forget. Tired men in talking
to her forgot they were tired: old men that they
were no longer young. These undoubtedly were
valuable social gifts. At times she could talk of
things of which she knew very little, but there
were many who would not be quick enough to
discover it, and she would be quick enough to discover
those that were. Those people she could
make talk and she would listen. St. Jermyn saw all
this, saw she was still very young, and it was easy
enough to imagine what she would be when she
was older. She would speak well, he was sure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
that, she was without self-consciousness, and had
a quaint turn of mind that would be useful at
election times, and at all times delightful. If it was
as a hostess he had fallen in love with her, it was
also as a girl and a woman: but he knew she did
not care for him, and the thought of his career
helped him to bear the blow. He had still something
to live for. So when he got back to the Scotts’—having
quite forgotten he had called Diana “Diana”
to Hastings, and being perfectly innocent of
the havoc he had wrought—he was feeling sorry
for himself: and saw himself as an interesting young
man recovering from a love-affair: wondered how
it would read when his life came to be written and
wondered if any one writing of it would do justice
to his tenderness? He had an undefined feeling that
every one must be a little kinder to him than usual,
to make up, as it were. So when he found Sheila
Scott sitting in a window-seat in the great hall,
reading “Hansard,” he felt very much drawn to
her, and caused her an agony of shyness by forcing
her to say why she was reading anything so dry.
She found it difficult to say, “Because you said
the other day that some one should look something
up in ‘Hansard.’” He didn’t know that in the eyes
of this dear little red-haired, freckle-faced girl—born
to be a beauty yet—he was a hero. If he had
seen Diana in Downing Street—Sheila had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
him there dozens of times, in different guises:
hardly ever as himself, which would have distressed
him. She had seen him—Lohengrin at Downing
Street: Sir Philip Sidney at Downing Street: Sidney
Carton at Downing Street: the Scarlet Pimpernel
even, at Downing Street. He had been her
every hero in turn, and always Prime Minister in
addition to everything else. He couldn’t know this,
but he had taken the book away from her: holding
her wrists until she had promised to give it to him.
Finally she had given it to him and he had read
aloud to her from its pages. Dull reading enough;
but to her nothing like it had ever been written.
Her eyes grew larger and larger, and her lips
parted as she listened to the charming modulations
of his voice. St. Jermyn was just discovering how
really pretty she was; had just won from her the
promise to read all his speeches, if ever they came
to be published, and she had just said, “I will”—and
no “I will” was ever more solemnly said—not
even in St. Paul’s, Knightsbridge—when her
mother came into the hall.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry Ralph, darling,” she said. “She’s
so fond of fairy stories—even at her age,”—this
to Ralph as Sheila left them, and Ralph smiled as
his eyes followed her.</p>

<p>“You will remember she is only a child?” Mrs.
Scott said gently as she took Sheila’s seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>St. Jermyn wondered if she were such a child,
after all?</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said her mother, “it is not so much
that she’s a child as that I want you to remember
she is a woman. Am I very difficult to understand?”</p>

<p>Ralph thought he understood her perfectly.</p>

<p>“You know, Ralph, I am being absolutely frank
with you; the child is very fond of you but we both
know—both she and I—that you are fond of
some one else. You won’t think because she’s
rather a nice thing, and young, that she—”</p>

<p>St. Jermyn interrupted her. “My dear Janet,”
he said, “I quite understand. The truth is I was
feeling the want of a little sympathy—it is quite
true, I did care enormously for some one—but she
doesn’t care for me, and I am going to devote
myself to politics—it’s horrible to have to admit
it, but I am afraid they will always come first with
me. I shall some day, I am sure, make a very good
and devoted husband, I feel certain of that—and
I believe I could make a woman happy, but her
interest in life must be—not my interests—but
<em>Me</em>. I wonder if you understand—I am showing
myself in a very poor light.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Scott rose from the window-seat, and laying
her hand on his shoulder said, “My dear boy,
in a very bad light—but I don’t believe you are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
half so selfish as you make out. The day will come
when you will fall desperately in love—don’t, I
most earnestly beg of you, wait till Diana is married,
and then fall in love with her—for your sake,
not hers! She would run no danger—but don’t
do it! It really need not be part of a political life—and
don’t think too much of that life of yours
that may some day be written. Have you forgiven
me?”</p>

<p>St. Jermyn was almost sure he had. If forgetting
is forgiving he very soon forgave her. What he did
not forget was the sight of that absurd child sitting
in the window-seat reading “Hansard.” How he
wished it had been Diana who for his sake had
read it!</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Elsie Carston got the letter from Diana
with its P.S., pregnant with meaning,
asking her to telegraph for her at once on any pretext
she chose, Elsie was triumphant. Marcus had
failed. Not even the attractions of Scotland could
hold Diana. She was evidently dying to get back
to her aunt. It was no good forcing things down
the throats, as it were, of young people: it was
not what you gave them that counted, it was
what you were to them.</p>

<p>“Shan’t, Diana is coming back,” she announced
with pride. This was her triumph—she was the
chosen one.</p>

<p>“Then shall I go to my darlin’ Uncle Marcus?”
asked Shan’t, radiant; “oh, do let me—for
once.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, Uncle Marcus won’t want you.”</p>

<p>“Why won’t he?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why, but he won’t!”</p>

<p>“Then I shall write to him,” said Shan’t—“a
very, very long letter, and he will write back and
ask his darlin’ little Shan’t to come and stay with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
him—see if he doesn’t!” And Shan’t opened her
eyes wide—and nodded her head at Aunt Elsie
three times. It was not what Shan’t said, it was
the way she said it that Aunt Elsie found so cruel.
Why had this wretched uncle ever come into
their lives? For years he had refused to accept responsibilities,
and now that the children had come
to an age when they were most charming and attractive,
he had suddenly awakened to a belated
sense of duty. It was very annoying. But Diana
was coming home and Elsie went up to tell Mrs.
Sloane so.</p>

<p>She at least would rejoice with Elsie and would
not affect an absurd love for Uncle Marcus. Shan’t
must have known how very disagreeable it was
always hearing Marcus talked of as if he were the
only uncle in the world. Elsie found Mrs. Sloane
where she best loved to be, in the garden. From
the seat on which she sat she looked through a gap
cut in the tall yew hedges on to the range of hills—blue
in the distance. Between her and the hills
were golden cornfields, green fields, fields where
the red soil was newly turned, and trees—dark
fir trees standing like sentinels against the sky-line,
plumed beeches, spreading oaks—and at her feet
every flower that grows, rioting, singing at the
tops of their voices, in wide borders, for flowers do
sing for those who love them. Was it any wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
that her face was beautiful when she turned it in
welcome towards Elsie?</p>

<p>“Proud woman!” said Elsie, “I see in your
smile the measure of your penstemons; in your
eyes the pride of your hollyhocks; in your whole
demeanour the glory of your garden. I don’t believe
there is any woman more difficult to bear
with than she for whom all things grow.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane supposed it was not of gardens,
though, that Elsie had come to talk. Her look was
not of gardens. Their look of peace was not hers:
there was something of aggression in her manner.
It could not be directed against a woman so peaceable,
so peace-loving as herself. She smiled, and
Elsie was bound to admit she was right.</p>

<p>“Yet you are an aggravating woman, with your
perfections always before us. Tommy Wandle told
me last night he had been to see your new pig-sties.
He was so awe-struck that I asked him what
they were like, and he said, ‘I thought they was a
post-office, miss.’ Now a woman whose pig-sties
are like post-offices is not a neighbour to be loved
as one’s self, but lend me your attention, for I am
in trouble.”</p>

<p>There was no nearer way to the heart of Mrs.
Sloane than this.</p>

<p>She begged Elsie to tell her everything, which
Elsie did, and Mrs. Sloane was delightfully interested.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
She asked just the right questions—a
great art this, and one that makes dear friends
of those who possess that power of discrimination.
She was shocked at Shan’t’s love of change,
and hoped with Elsie that nothing of an unhappy
nature had occurred at Glenbossie. It was possible,
of course, that Diana had had some little love-affair.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” said Elsie, “she would have told
me.”</p>

<p>“She may be coming home in order to do
that.”</p>

<p>Of course, that was possible, Elsie admitted, and
added: “There is a Captain Hastings there.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane wondered if he could be the son of
her old friend? If he were and resembled his father
and grandfather, she had every reason to believe
the danger to Diana must have been considerable—it
was quite possible she was coming home to
bring good news.</p>

<p>“Then there is Mr. St. Jermyn too.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane looked serious. Diana had been subjected
to great danger, on all sides—and they,
too, of course, had run considerable risks of unhappiness.
Mr. Maitland was a clever matchmaker
and he had chosen very well. One man was
rich and the other he could help to make rich.
Diana was very happily situated with an uncle so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
rich and so devoted—devoted from a sense of
duty only, of course, said Mrs. Sloane.</p>

<p>“But he is a very kind man,” she added; “here
is evidence of it.” And she drew a letter from a bag
that lay beside her on the seat. She opened it and
read: “‘I cannot tell you what I feel about Mr.
Maitland—he is a perfect angel—and I shall
love him as long as I live and we shall pray for him
every night of our lives.’</p>

<p>“High praise that,” said Mrs. Sloane, smiling;
“it comes from a very pretty young woman too.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say he wouldn’t be kind to a pretty
young woman and I am not sure that it is greatly
to his credit to admit it,” said Elsie.</p>

<p>“Elsie, Elsie,” said Mrs. Sloane, laughing, “I
see what was once a charming and delightful nature
growing warped and—shall we say a little
soured?—and all because a man—in every other
way we will admit it, depraved and horrible—is
kind to the children of his sister.”</p>

<p>“Not soured,” said Elsie, laughing; “I’m quite
nice really—I don’t really dislike him, even, but
I do resent his suddenly awaking to his responsibilities
and treating me as though I had no right
to exist.” Then she added: “But tell me about
this young woman—if it can be told.”</p>

<p>It could be told, and Elsie learned how much
Shan’t had had to do in the matter: how she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
drawn Uncle Marcus into the affair, and at the end
of the story Elsie could not easily impute any great
blame to Uncle Marcus.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mrs. Sloane, “he will receive a
shock one of these days and we must do what we
can to help him to bear it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean he—cared for her?” asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>“No—but I am quite certain one of these days—very
soon, perhaps—he will receive a piece of
wedding cake, and with it a card, printed in silver,
and the name Madder will be crossed out and the
name Flueyn will remain—also in silver. Socially
it will shock him—pain him that he could have
been so kind to any one so lacking the social sense—but
she will be very happy.”</p>

<p>“Was she—is she—very pretty?” asked Elsie.</p>

<p>“She is very pretty—I used to think particularly
pretty when she raised her doggy eyes to
the defenceless Uncle Marcus, for he was defenceless
until he knew she wanted to marry Mr.
Flueyn.”</p>

<p>Elsie said he might have guessed she didn’t care
for him, and Mrs. Sloane said that was a thing men
hardly ever guessed.</p>

<p>“How do you understand men so well?” asked
Elsie, and Mrs. Sloane said it was perhaps because
she loved them so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>Aunt Elsie sent off the telegram, of course making
no excuse. If she wanted Diana she was perfectly
at liberty to say so; she was delighted she
was coming—delighted!</p>

<p>But when Diana came she was not so delighted,
because it was a different Diana who came back
from the one who had gone away. She was reserved,
a little hard, and a little defiant. Aunt Elsie hoped
she would look better after a night’s rest, she must
be tired and hungry. Diana admitted hunger: she
was frightfully hungry. Aunt Elsie, up in arms at
once, supposed Uncle Marcus had at least given
her a dinner-basket? Diana, defending Uncle Marcus,
said he was in no way to blame. He had given
her a parcel, she had asked for it instead of a
basket; but when she had opened the parcel, she
discovered the only things in it were two halves of
a cocoanut shell and a flask of whiskey—not sustaining
in the ordinary sense of the word.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say,” asked Aunt Elsie with a
righteous indignation the force of which shook her,
“that he played a practical joke?—a man of his
age—how abominable!”</p>

<p>Diana vowed it was too good a joke for Uncle
Marcus to have perpetrated, and as a matter of
fact it was the only part of the journey she had
enjoyed, which was quite true, though she could
not tell Elsie why. If Miles could play a practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
joke, she had argued to herself, he could not be
so angry as she imagined he was, though why he
should be angry at all she could not imagine. Mr.
St. Jermyn had understood the joke, poor as it had
been, but Miles had not spoken to her after he
came back from the island and the next morning
he was gone. She could not tell Aunt Elsie this because
it would mean telling her a great many other
things that she could not tell any one.</p>

<p>Miles had not even shown her Robinson, the
little bird he had found on the island—every one
else had seen it and it had pecked every one’s
fingers but hers.</p>

<p>The mistake Pillar had made with the luncheon-basket
remained the one bright spot on a dark
horizon because she did not know it was Pillar’s
mistake.</p>

<p>“What is Scotland like?” asked Shan’t.</p>

<p>“There are rocks and burns—and hills and
lochs,” said Diana absent-mindedly—for her
heart was still there.</p>

<p>“How lovely!” sighed Shan’t, knowing nothing
of lochs and burns, but Diana had been there and
Uncle Marcus was there and she did so want to go.
“And what else?”</p>

<p>“On an island in the middle of the sea there
was a little bird that would have died if some one
hadn’t rescued it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“In the mid-dle of the sea?” asked Shan’t—incredulous.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And did some one rescue the darlin’ little
bird?”</p>

<p>“Yes—”</p>

<p>“What was it called?”</p>

<p>“Robinson.”</p>

<p>“Did it know it was?”</p>

<p>“Was what?”</p>

<p>“Called by that name?”</p>

<p>“No—it was christened that by the—person
who rescued it.”</p>

<p>“Not properly christened?” A good Churchwoman
was Shan’t.</p>

<p>“No—not quite properly.”</p>

<p>“And what else are there in—Scotland?”</p>

<p>“There are grouse and deer and fish and heather—and
moss—”</p>

<p>“Do you like it better than anywhere?”</p>

<p>Diana didn’t answer.</p>

<p>“Better than the seaside?” went on Shan’t.</p>

<p>Still Diana did not answer.</p>

<p>“Better than Hastings?” persisted Shan’t.</p>

<p>“What did you say, Shan’t?”</p>

<p>“I said—did you like Scotland best or—Hastings,
where we go to the seaside sometimes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“I like Hastings best,” said Diana, and she
caught Shan’t in her arms; “but, darling, you
must never tell any one—promise.”</p>

<p>“Scotland wouldn’t mind, because you do like
it, too, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“I love it.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could go there!”</p>

<p>Diana didn’t see why she shouldn’t. She would
write and suggest it to Uncle Marcus: she had to
write and explain, so far as she could, her running
away. He would be very angry, she knew. She
wrote:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Marcus</span>—Uncle no longer—I feel
the age you don’t look, so I shall call you Marcus.
It was cowardly to run away, wasn’t it?
But I could not stand the atmosphere, it was too
heavy. I was an idiot, but not more than that, and
it was a poor joke, I admit it. I had a lovely time
in spite of it, and I thank you thousands of times.
I want you to ask Shan’t. She would love it
so, and she would be no trouble whatever. John
could look after her all day. I really think she
would amuse you. I am glad I came home; Aunt
Elsie, I am afraid, is in for an attack of sciatica.
She was so pleased to see me. Who else has such
a ridiculous aunt and such an absurd uncle as I
have?</p>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>She was going to enclose a letter from Shan’t,
having promised not to look at it.</p>

<p>“Promise?” asked Shan’t, folding it.</p>

<p>Diana promised. There was nothing Shan’t
liked better than to write letters all by herself.</p>

<p>This is the one she wrote all by herself that
Diana enclosed in hers “without looking”:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear uncle marcus, I mean my dearling will you
ask me to come to scotland becawse I do love it
so diana is very well but she loves hastings please
say yes darling uncle marcus from your loving
<span class="smcap">Shan’t</span>.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>And this is the letter that brought Uncle Marcus
down from Scotland by the first train. All personal
feeling must now go to the wind. What Miss
Carston felt about the matter he did not care.
She must tell him what she knew. She must help
him. There could be now no jealousy between
them. The child they loved was unhappy; he had
seen that. Miss Carston must by now have seen it.
Their hearts were united in a common cause.
Diana must be happy. If she loved Hastings, it
was the duty of Uncle Marcus, without making it
difficult for Diana, to find out if Hastings loved
her. Marcus was morally certain he did. Of course
he did! He had fished with her and had shot with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
her; they had walked together and talked—Heavens,
how they had talked! Didn’t Marcus
know it to his cost? But nothing would matter if
Diana were happy in the end and Elsie must help
to that end. It was not a question of which of them
had the means to make her happy; she might take
all the <em>kudos</em> so long as Diana was happy.</p>

<p>Never had Uncle Marcus reached such heights
of self-effacement. He now saw clearly enough
that the feud between him and Miss Carston had
been in the nature of a joke—a poor joke, but a
joke. It had amused them to imagine themselves
enemies. They were now fighters in a common
cause.</p>

<p>Dear little Shan’t had told him all he wanted to
know—in her innocence she had lightened his
path and he now saw clearly. It only remained for
Aunt Elsie to be as frank with him as he meant to
be with her.</p>

<p>Aunt Elsie, knowing nothing of all this, was laid
up on the sofa with an attack of sciatica and with
her was Diana sympathizing.</p>

<p>Diana meanwhile was looking out of the window.
“Why, there’s Uncle Marcus!” she exclaimed.
“What in the world has he come for?”</p>

<p>As Uncle Marcus jumped out of the car a
thought struck her. “Aunt Elsie,” she said, “you
are to say nothing to Uncle Marcus, swear—promise—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
trust to you—here is your chance—promise!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? I know nothing.”</p>

<p>“That is not the point: you are not to discuss
me! I won’t have it! Promise? Darling—I love
you <em>so</em>—promise!”</p>

<p>Aunt Elsie promised; Diana had taken her
middle stump with a “googlie.” Rebecca came to
say, would Miss Carston see Mr. Maitland for
a few moments? He had come from Scotland on
purpose?</p>

<p>Miss Carston would see Mr. Maitland, and
this—according to Diana—is what happened—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Maitland.</span> What did Diana say?</p>

<br>

<p>At that moment Diana, Shan’t, and the doctor
came into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“You, Uncle Marcus!” exclaimed Diana with
rapture.</p>

<p>“Oh, have you come to fetch me, darlin’ Uncle
Marcus?” cried Shan’t, ecstatically, throwing herself
into his arms.</p>

<p>“Do you want her?” asked Aunt Elsie, who had
much to make up, if anything could ever make up.
She gave one hand to the doctor, the other to
Marcus, dismissing him. “Did you really come to
fetch her? It was good of you. Nannie will get her
things together as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>Uncle Marcus said nothing—he was furious:
he had not come to fetch Shan’t and Miss Carston
knew it.</p>

<p>Later in the day Diana threw her arms round
Aunt Elsie and told her how wonderful the dogs
had been—“too—too wonderful!”</p>

<p>Aunt Elsie thought she deserved some praise,
and Diana allowed she had been too clever for
words.</p>

<p>“But think of the cost,” said Aunt Elsie, aching
for sympathy.</p>

<p>Diana affected surprise. Did Aunt Elsie mean
that she minded what Uncle Marcus thought of
her? “It wasn’t as if you wanted to marry him,
darling?” she said, seeking to comfort her.</p>

<p>Marry him? Elsie was horrified at the mere
thought; but argued that, although you might not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
want to marry a man, you might not necessarily
want to appear an idiot in his eyes. Further, she
vowed Diana must have marrying on the brain to
have thought of such a thing; and Diana said,
What if she had? Whereupon Elsie understood
everything in a flash, as it were (so she said).
Diana, steadying her, begged her not to understand
too much—it was so dangerous—so bewildering—and
so overwhelming—it should come
gradually, not like an avalanche.</p>

<p>“But you must tell me, darling; think what I
have done for you,” pleaded Aunt Elsie. She deserved
some reward.</p>

<p>There was nothing to tell. Diana said she had
muddled it all. Then there had been something!
It could be put right—there was no muddle so
bad that an aunt couldn’t straighten it out! All
eagerness was Elsie.</p>

<p>“Isn’t there?” asked Diana. “Uncles and aunts
are wonderful people.” And she would say nothing
more.</p>

<p>“It was rather brilliant on my part, though,
wasn’t it?” asked Aunt Elsie, still longing for
praise—if she had seemed foolish she would at
least have been foolish in a good cause.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the dogs!” said Diana.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Marcus</span> refused to wait even for the joy of
wresting Shan’t from her aunt. He was
furious. Miss Carston had deliberately made a
fool of him; in doing it she had made a fool of
herself, too, but that did not make it any the
better. With herself she might do what she liked;
but she had no right to treat him as she had done.
He had come inspired with the best motives; had
been thinking of nothing but the happiness of Diana.
To secure that he had been willing to forget
everything that had passed between himself and
the aunt.</p>

<p>That there was something she had promised
Diana not to tell him was quite evident, but she
might have adopted some other means of keeping
her promise. Was it likely he would have wished
to hear anything Diana did not wish to tell him?</p>

<p>That was a question an injured man might ask
himself without guessing the right answer.</p>

<p>He had said he would wait in London for Shan’t—he
could not disappoint the child, and her Nannie
had promised to deliver her up the next day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
with sufficient overalls, jerseys, shoes, and socks,
etc., for a fortnight.</p>

<p>“You can manage the journey, sir?” Nannie
had asked, doubting, and Mr. Maitland had said
a housemaid was returning to Scotland with him
who would look after her.</p>

<p>So Shan’t went to Scotland, and about what
happened on the journey Uncle Marcus forever
held his speech, but he was a wreck when he got
to Glenbossie, and was thankful to hand her over
to a housemaid who could manage her. The travelling
one had signally failed. “She didn’t understand
me a bit,” said Shan’t; “she simply couldn’t
keep me in order, could she?”—this triumphantly
to Uncle Marcus. “She could not,” he agreed;
whereupon she informed him that it was no use
just telling her not to do things. “You must be
firm,” she explained.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Uncle Marcus.</p>

<p>Shan’t must have written a letter full of boastful
arrogance to Dick, because she got one from him,
by what she called “returnal post,” and in it he
said: “I don’t suppose your place is like this—it’s
simply toppin’. Mr. Taboret got forty brace of
grouse to his own gun the other day, and not content
with that effort he went out when it was yet
light and got three salmon! I saw him do the
mighty deed—then in the evening he danced—he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
wears a kilt—does Uncle Marcus? This house
is about as big as the Albert Hall in London, I
should think, from what I can remember of it.
They got four hundred brace of grouse the other
day—I sat in a butt, with a Duke, I think he
was, but he wasn’t at all a bad sort of chap; he
wore a kilt too and his beard was red”: in answer
to which Shan’t wrote a pithy post-card: “we
shoot dere hear,” which brought forth a stinging
reply: “I have shot two roe <em>deer</em>—not <em>dere</em>; you
spelt it wrong—write it out four hundred times—it’s
not supposed to be good form to shoot roe deer
with a shot-gun; does Uncle Marcus?”</p>

<p>“Do you?” asked Shan’t anxiously of her uncle,
her sporting world trembling in the balance.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Shan’t wrote, “He says he doesunt”—and
there the correspondence ended.</p>

<p>To any reference on the part of Shan’t to her
darlin’ Aunt Elsie, Marcus turned a deaf ear, and
to Shan’t a stony countenance, and Shan’t learnt
very quickly not to talk about her darlin’ aunt,
but, child though she was, she felt there was disloyalty
in that, so she thought about her a great
deal—and when Uncle Marcus said: “What are
you thinking about, Shan’t?” she would piously
answer: “You wouldn’t like if I said!”</p>

<p>She lo-oved Scotland. She bathed and she paddled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
and she went out in a boat with John and she
f-ished! And John spoilt her, as only a man knows
how to spoil.</p>

<p>She quickly learnt at which farm—and it was
at every farm—she could get oat cakes and milk
at any time of the day, and she was convinced it
was French the Scotch spoke, and when they called
her wee, she said. “Mais non!”</p>

<p>She sat with joy under the Minister. The service
was never too long, because at the end of it
came a money-box on the end of a pole, which was
poked into the face of every member of the congregation,
and finally made its way upstairs and
round the galleries, which perambulations she
loved. She rode a cream-coloured pony, with a
black stripe down his back, on the hill, and a fine
swagger was hers as she rode up the steep, narrow
tracks with Sandy and John walking one on either
side of her, through the heather: she discoursing
all the while on the differences between a church
and a kirk—which were mainly, it seemed, the
differences between dull bags or plates and a box
on the end of a stick; serious differences, these.
“There’s an a’ful difference between them whatever,”
agreed John, but then he agreed to everything
she said.</p>

<p>She was frightfully spoilt and Marcus was not
behind the others in doing his share of the spoiling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
So when she was thrown from the pony and lay in
her bed unconscious, a black cloud hung over the
Lodge of Glenbossie, and Marcus, in the depths
of despair, wandered here and there unable to do
anything because he had done everything that
could be done and it had not availed. Sandy and
John just stood around, to be there if anything
should happen—and nothing happened, that was
the worst of it. Anything—excepting, of course,
one thing—would be better than this lying still—conscious
of nothing. Mrs. Oven was so cross no
one could go near her. It was the way sorrow took
her, she told Pillar, who had dared to demand an
explanation.</p>

<p>The household refused to be comforted, and
when the Minister came to pray for the “wee
lassie,” Uncle Marcus turned upon him furiously,
saying, “It’s not come to that yet,” which was an
old story, but it showed how true that old story
was to human nature: and the Minister, no doubt,
went on praying: being too devout a man to be
deterred, and knowing probably that Mr. Maitland,
like many another good man, had not yet
met God face to face.</p>

<p>Then Aunt Elsie arrived wearing what Diana
would have called a hat without a kick left in
it, of which hat Marcus approved. It seemed impossible
now to associate her with absurd behaviour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
Here was no woman playing ridiculous
jokes, with little fun in them, but a woman calm,
composed, and most unhappy.</p>

<p>Marcus was glad she wouldn’t have anything
to eat until she had seen Shan’t, and seen for herself
how ill she was. Elsie thought it was impossible
she could be so ill as Mr. Maitland had led her to
expect; she was certain he exaggerated as all men
did. The very fact of their strength made them
overestimate the weakness of others. She followed
him upstairs, and as he stopped at a door he put a
finger to his lips. At any other time she might have
resented this and might have said, Was it likely
she would go into a sick-room talking and laughing?
But now she nodded her head. She was an
aunt subdued. She followed him into a darkened
room: and a nurse rose from the bedside. She did
not put her finger to her lips because she knew
how unlikely it was that Shan’t could be disturbed
by anything.</p>

<p>“There’s no change,” she said.</p>

<p>“Go and rest,” said Marcus, and she went; perhaps
the calm grey eyes of Elsie gave her a sense
of security. At all events, she did not question the
right of the new-comer to wait and watch. Marcus
sat down at one side of the bed, Elsie at the other.
They seemed so near to one another, divided only
by the ridge of bedclothes so slightly raised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>“Concussion,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Elsie nodded; she never spoke. He wished she
would say something, possibly: How terrible it
must have been for him! Then he might have said:
What a journey it must have been for her! But she
said nothing. Her eyes never left Shan’t’s face.
Sometimes Marcus looked from Shan’t to Elsie.
In the daylight darkness—the blinds were drawn—he
could see, he thought, why it was the children
were so fond of her, and why, if her brother
in any way resembled her, Sibyl was so devoted to
him. He liked her quietness—although she might,
perhaps, have said a few words: but that was a
thing no woman could do. If she had spoken at all
she must have spoken too much.</p>

<p>And so Marcus and Elsie, when they were not
eating or sleeping, and they ate very little and
slept hardly at all, sat and watched. And while they
watched, Elsie had time to discover that Marcus
had nice hands and he to find that he rather liked
the way her hair grew; and that was all. He was
the uncle on the one side—she the aunt on the
other—of Shan’t’s bed—so small a thing dividing
them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Mrs. Sloane</span> was distressed about Diana,
and her old eyes were quick to see a change
in the girl whose reticence about her visit to Scotland
was unusual in one who was accustomed to
confide.</p>

<p>When the news of Shan’t’s accident came her
grief was unnatural in its overwhelming force.
Diana looked reluctantly upon the black side of
things: and was always eager to believe that things
must come right. A happy Diana would have refused
to believe that anything could happen to
Shan’t for the very good reason that she loved her.
Here, then, thought Mrs. Sloane, was an accumulation
of sorrow, sorrow, that had been held back
by force, let go. The telegram had said nothing
of danger, so Mrs. Sloane knew Diana was glad of
the excuse to cry, and she, of course, was right, as
understanding old women usually are.</p>

<p>So she set about to stem the tide of Diana’s
grief.</p>

<p>She wrote to Mrs. Hastings and begged the loan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
of her son for a few days, because of those other
days of long ago. She wanted to see what (she
meant who) he was like: and, of course, Miles’s
mother was only too delighted any one should see
what her son was like, so he was despatched to
London—against his will—to see Mrs. Sloane:
not to Bestways; that would have been too clumsy
a move on the part of the old lady, and too obvious.
She had yet to make a complete plan: London,
at present, was as far as she had got in her
manœuvres.</p>

<p>Just before she started Diana flew in—it was
the word Mrs. Sloane invariably used to describe
Diana’s movements: she had a telegram in her
hand which she gave in silence to Mrs. Sloane to
read. And in silence Mrs. Sloane read it. Shan’t
was not so well.</p>

<p>“I must go to-night,” said Diana.</p>

<p>“You must go, of course,” said Mrs. Sloane,
adding that she would have waited and gone with
her, so far as London: but she had an engagement
for luncheon.</p>

<p>So Mrs. Sloane went to London alone and drove
straight to that hotel at which she knew a young
man would like best to lunch: although she had a
very shrewd suspicion that she was about to rob a
young man of his rightful appetite. When she arrived
at the hotel she went into one of the rooms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
where she was most certain of seclusion, and sat
down in one of the windows to wait. Personally
she would have preferred one of the quieter, older-fashioned
hotels: but this was a concession on her
part to fashion and to youth.</p>

<p>She had only to wait a few minutes when into
the room came a young man, and at the sight of
him her heart stirred, for reasons of its own, not
unknown to her. A vast area of rose-coloured
carpet, a vista of mirrors, and rows of pillars generally
have a dwarfing effect, but Miles Hastings
looked very big and absurdly like his grandfather.
Her heart was beating normally again as she rose
to meet the young man, and going up to him she
slipped her hand within his arm and gave it a
little squeeze of affection. “How kind of you to
come!”</p>

<p>He smiled, wondering what this dear old lady
wanted.</p>

<p>“Let me look at you,” she said. “You have
grown!”</p>

<p>He said it was perhaps a long time since she had
seen him.</p>

<p>“You were a baby in arms when I last saw you.”</p>

<p>Miles Hastings laughed, and turned to look
again at this old friend of his mother—and perhaps,
he thought, of his father—and saw that her
cheeks were flushed—most delicately flushed—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
her eyes were bright with excitement. He wondered
why? There was nothing very exciting about
him, he feared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane gently directed him towards the
sofa in the window.</p>

<p>“Now let me look at you properly,” she said,
putting up her glasses.</p>

<p>“Deal with me mercifully,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“I see no reason to do that,” she answered.</p>

<p>“It’s awfully good of you,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“I am going to be much gooder than that—as
Shan’t says.”</p>

<p>“Shan’t?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Shan’t; do you know her?”</p>

<p>“No.” He did not know her, but he was beginning
to understand the flush on the cheeks of
the old lady and the light in her kind old eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s a pity, as Shan’t herself would say;
but now to business. I want you to do something
for me. I knew your grandfather; if that is not
reason enough you must do it for me because I
am old—and a woman, and because I want you
to do it.”</p>

<p>“I will do anything you ask me to do—because
you are you.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane smiled: she was beginning to envy
Diana.</p>

<p>“Some one I am very fond of is going to Scotland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
to-night—she is unhappy and she is anxious. I
cannot bear to think of her to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“I guess—” he began.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane laid a restraining hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“—struggling for a breakfast-basket—there’s
no time at which you so much want a man, don’t
you agree?—even if you have a maid?”</p>

<p>Miles was ready to agree to anything.</p>

<p>“I have two conditions to make—one is that
you do not see her, or speak to her to-night, and
the other is that you leave her to-morrow morning,
when you have seen her into the train which
will take her to her destination—you agree?”</p>

<p>Miles agreed; adding, “I am wondering if you
are an angel in disguise.”</p>

<p>“In disguise? Is that quite kind?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me—when the gate of Heaven opens
suddenly the light is blinding. You are a dear!”
And he looked at her in a way that opened up
a whole world of romance. If he should look at
Diana to-morrow even as he had looked at an old
woman to-day, Diana would possibly make a poor
breakfast in the morning, but would be very
happy some day.</p>

<p>At luncheon Mrs. Sloane and Miles were the
object of a certain amount of speculation, and
a greater amount of interest. By most people
they were voted grandmother and grandson—by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
others mother and son. Two people gave it up.
One of them was a big young man with a shock of
fair hair, and the other was the girl with him, who
knew Mrs. Sloane had no son.</p>

<p>“Speak to her,” said Mr. Flueyn.</p>

<p>Rose was shy. If the pillars and mirrors had not
dwarfed Miles, they frightened her. She was as
appalled by their magnificence as she was by that
of her new hat. Her marriage had been so hastily
arranged that only that morning had she had time
to send Mr. Maitland his bit of wedding cake, and
she had altogether forgotten Mrs. Sloane’s.</p>

<p>“You look so pretty, darling,” urged her husband,
“she won’t mind about the cake.”</p>

<p>And Rose, taking courage, walked across to the
table where Mrs. Sloane and Miles Hastings sat.
With a pang she realized the extreme order of this
young man’s hair: then with a rush of loyalty she
asked Mrs. Sloane if she might introduce her husband.</p>

<p>“My dear child, do, I shall be so glad to meet
him.”</p>

<p>And Rose motioned him to come, and across the
room he came, like a breeze ruffling the surface of
a loch. Mrs. Sloane felt braced at his approach,
and, though suffering acutely under the force of
his handshake, smiled bravely. To his question,
What did she think of the wife? she answered that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
she thought her radiantly pretty. To the question,
What did she think of the hat? she less truthfully
vowed it charming. To his account of how and why
the marriage had been hastened on, she lent an
interested attention, and when he and Rose had
been made thoroughly happy by her charming
appreciation of everything, and the promise of a
present to come, they left: Rose returning to say
hurriedly that she was so sorry she had forgotten
the cake. It was coming! She hoped Mrs. Sloane
had not thought her rude. “I only sent Mr. Maitland’s
to-day. I hope he won’t think me rude not
having sent it at once. He of all people in the
world—I should never forget.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Sloane was quite sure Mr. Maitland would
not think her rude. Then she turned to Miles,
wondering what he would say. She knew exactly
what Marcus would have said—about the
hat.</p>

<p>“Happy young things,” said Miles, despatching
them from his mind with a smile. Then he leant
forward, as though some thought had suddenly
struck him. “About those conditions you have
exacted,” he said; “supposing certain contingencies
should arise, must I—am I in honour bound—to
leave this—person of whom you are very fond
when I have seen her into the train that takes her
on—you know <em>where</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>“That was one of my conditions! You accepted
it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I mean to abide by it—but supposing—I
only say supposing—it is more than I
can bear; the separation, I mean; may I at the
last moment jump into the guard’s van, if I don’t
let her know I’m on the train? It’s only a remote
possibility, but I might feel unable to abide
by your condition.”</p>

<p>“You promised to—”</p>

<p>“And I mean to—but if I give my word of
honour I can’t break it—therefore, I only want
your permission to do this in circumstances over
which I might possibly have no control: if, let us
say, she should look so beautiful that I lost my
head—if by chance, let us say, she should smile
at me—you know how she does smile—I suppose
you do—! Well, may I use my own judgment?
It only means that I shall be in the same train. I
won’t speak to her or let her see me?”</p>

<p>“Under very exceptional circumstances—and
I leave it to your sense of honour not to make
them exceptional—you may travel in the guard’s
van—without letting her know you are there.”
And Mrs. Sloane, looking at him, shook her head
as old women will do in affectionate despair at
those young people of whom they most particularly
approve.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> was not so easy for Miles to hide himself at
Euston Station as Mrs. Sloane had seemed to
imagine. He was one of those who show in a
crowd, being bigger than most, and, according to
his mother, handsomer. And he was a little reckless
until he had seen the object of his search.
Once he had seen Diana walk down the platform
with her chin in the air, as was her habit, approved
by her uncle, who thought she walked as a woman
should walk, and as few did, he was more cautious,
and dodged behind mountains of luggage, but
never losing sight of the figure in blue tweed. She
wore her hat well pulled down over her eyes, and
he was glad. Once his he would want the whole
world to see her, but till then he would have all
men blind to her beauty. He bet himself five shillings
she would buy “Blackwood” at the bookstall,
and she bought it. Feeling himself the richer
of five shillings—he held himself justified in giving
it to the porter who was looking after her
luggage: then he committed her to the care of the
guard, and he asked nothing of the guard he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
not ready to pay for. At the last moment he took
possession of his sleeping-compartment within a
few doors of Diana’s. Then he committed her into
God’s safe keeping for the night—the guard on
the train and God in Heaven; she must be safe.
To the guard he had offered money—to God he
offered the rest of his life if He would only give
him Diana, to take care of—forever. Was it irreverent?
Far from it, never in his life had he felt
more humbly reverent.</p>

<p>Diana as she travelled thought how different it
had been so short a time ago when she had travelled
up with Uncle Marcus. Now there was nothing
to look forward to and everything to dread.
Shan’t might be dangerously ill! That she might
not recover Diana would not have admitted even
to herself. But there was the feeling underneath
everything that life might not give her all she had
asked of it. The thought was disquieting because
she had asked of it only what she must have!
Diana was young and she slept—although she
had been certain she could not sleep—and she
awoke in Scotland, and Scotland is Scotland and
must not be denied. She demands, at least, that
the traveller shall look out and wonder at her
beauty. So Diana dressed and went out into the
corridor and looked down into the glens, rushing
past; on to the rowans, red with berries, and up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
to the torrents of water that streamed down the
mountain-sides. Life, after all, could not cheat her.
The morning sang aloud for very joy; not only
the burns and the waterfalls, but everything sang.</p>

<p>Then she discovered she was hungry and she
was certain she could never get a breakfast-basket.
Arrived at the station, where these things are to be
had, for those who have the forethought to order
them, she looked out of the window, and the first
thing she saw was Miles Hastings striding towards
her—followed by a man carrying two breakfast-baskets.</p>

<p>“You!” she exclaimed. “How did you get
here?”</p>

<p>“By train, just as you did,” he answered. “I
knew your father wouldn’t like it if you didn’t
have your breakfast properly. You see my duties
don’t end when I land in England. Will you come
to another carriage? It’s not very nice eating
in a sleeping-berth, is it? Will you come? I have
reserved a compartment. This most excellent man
bears baps and bacon and eggs and marmalade
and tea. Coming?”</p>

<p>Diana was already coming, curiosity, if nothing
else, compelling her. How had he really come? She
had little dreamed that all night he had been so
close to her: that every time the train had stopped
at a station he had mounted guard outside her door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t talk until you have had breakfast,” he
said; “then I want to talk to you very seriously—don’t
look so adorable, because it upsets me. I
never imagined any one could look so clean as you
look after a journey.”</p>

<p>“And you have shaved, haven’t you?” she
asked; and he laughed and said he wouldn’t be
her father’s A.D.C. if he hadn’t. Then he assured
her—“Shan’t is going to get quite well. I read up
concussion, before I didn’t go to sleep last night.
Don’t ask any questions! Never ask me to explain
why I am here, because it cannot be explained except
that there are more angels on this earth than
even Heaven knows of. I always knew there was
one—go on eating.”</p>

<p>Diana reminded him that angels did not eat, but
in spite of that he begged her to have some more.
She couldn’t eat two eggs? Had she ever tried?
She couldn’t remember that she had. Not even
after hunting? No? They were dull things to talk
about, anyhow! Should he put the baskets under
the seat? He put them under the seat.</p>

<p>“Now tell me?” he said.</p>

<p>“Tell you what?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Why did he call you Diana?” Of enormous
importance this: it had weighed on his heart for
days, or weeks was it?</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Diana.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>“Do you really not know?”</p>

<p>She said so many people had called her by her
name: so few people called her by any one else’s.
She mightn’t have answered to Caroline if he—whoever
he was—had called her that. Then she
added: “It’s quite a nice name, though, isn’t it?
It’s a stately name.”</p>

<p>“Diana—do be nice to me,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>“Call me Caroline, and see.”</p>

<p>He called her Caroline, and she put out her hand
and withdrew it.</p>

<p>“Diana,” he said, “don’t tease me.”</p>

<p>“If he—whoever he was—had called me Caroline
you wouldn’t have minded?”</p>

<p>“If he had said Caroline had sent him to fetch
me off the island, I shouldn’t have known who in
the world Caroline was.”</p>

<p>“It was then he called me Diana, was it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was then.”</p>

<p>“How dared he spoil everything?”</p>

<p>“He did spoil everything; you admit it; then
you were happy?”—this triumphantly. It was
an admission on her part.</p>

<p>He was so desperately anxious she should admit
she had been happy; but she was in a distracting
and provoking mood. Why should she smile at the
hills and not at him? “Were you happy, Diana?
Tell me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>He wanted to know just how happy? Had she
been as happy as he had been? It was not possible.
She had not prayed for him every night as he had
prayed for her—she could not say she had?</p>

<p>No, she could not; she had never even thought
of him. But after they had met, he pleaded—then—had
she not thought of him? They must
compare notes. She vowed her notes were so
lightly pencilled on her memory, she could hardly
read them—a thought here, another there.</p>

<p>His notes were indelibly written on his heart.
The first time he had seen her was one. He told her
what he had thought of her. What had she thought
of him? She wouldn’t say. Driven to say something,
she confessed she had thought him—tall—yes,
tall <em>for his age</em>....</p>

<p>“Darling, don’t look out of the window. I know
your little nose by heart—I love your profile—but
tell me, do you remember anything else, I
mean what you thought of me—it sounds so
conceited to imagine for one moment that you
thought anything—but if you did—?”</p>

<p>“Let me think—don’t disturb me!” She shut
her eyes, and said, “I will try to remember.”</p>

<p>He waited. Was she really going to sleep? If he
had been Uncle Marcus he would have been taken
in; being more modern, he was not, but he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
never seen her asleep and she looked so lovely that
he let her sleep on, which was not in the least what
she had expected; moreover, it was very dull, so
she opened her eyes and asked if she had been
asleep? And when he said, “No,” she vowed to
herself this was no man to marry lightly—too
unerring an intuition was his.</p>

<p>“Will you always know what I am thinking and
feeling?” she asked.</p>

<p>He doubted it. He never knew of what she was
thinking or what she was feeling. “Tell me something
of what you feel.” And she told him how
hungry she had felt when she had travelled south,
from Loch Bossie, and what a comfort the parcel
had been, how glad she had been to see the cocoanut
shells.</p>

<p>“Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>Because, she said, she thought—as he had condescended
to a joke—a bad one, of course, but a
joke—it showed he could not be so angry with
her after all.</p>

<p>“And that comforted you?” Another admission,
this!</p>

<p>“Yes, it comforted me.”</p>

<p>“Then you must have minded my being angry
with you?”</p>

<p>Diana smiled at him. He was too, too clever.</p>

<p>Then he wanted to know about the parcel. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
had she got it? Because he had wanted it—he
had told Pillar so. “I wanted to keep it,” he said,
“and some day I was going to pay you out—when
you were hungry—on our honeymoon.”
She let this pass unchallenged. “Diana, did you
understand what I said?”</p>

<p>“Why should you have wanted to pay me out?
Did you mind being left on the island?” She ignored
the honeymoon.</p>

<p>And he said, of course he had minded. If she
had stayed with him, he would have loved it. As it
was, he had had no one to love but Robinson; he
could not imagine what he would have done without
Robinson, he had been so sympathetic and—jolly.</p>

<p>Diana wasn’t particularly interested in Robinson.
She wanted to know more about that loneliness
from which Miles had suffered so acutely. On
that he would not dwell, but rather on the happiness
of being on a desert island alone with Diana—some
day! Wouldn’t she love it? She thought so,
but suggested that if Pillar came too it might be
more comfortable. He admitted it, accusing her of
being a sybarite.</p>

<p>“You would never enjoy roughing it. You are
meant to walk on red carpets—oh—that fatal
snare of the red carpet! You shall walk on it
some day—but just for once let’s go to a desert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
island. Have you ever imagined what it would
be?”</p>

<p>Then Diana turned her face from the window to
look at Miles, and she asked him if they had not
both been on a desert island—each on their own—the
last few days—or was it years? And Miles,
seeing in her eyes the smile she had kept throughout
the journey for mountains and burns, jumped
to a glorious conclusion.</p>

<p>“You mean that the whole world is a desert
island if we are not together?”</p>

<p>And that was just what she did mean, although
she had not been able to express it. She had hesitated
to put it into words, and now that she found
the courage she found no words and she discovered,
like many another before her, that they are
but dumb things after all: that there are other
ways and better ways of saying things: that nothing
is so expressive as a silence, nothing tells so
much or tells it so tenderly—that is, if it be a
happy silence. The unbroken silence of misunderstanding
is another thing.</p>

<p>“Now tell me,” she said, “what you want to
say—I will be very serious.”</p>

<p>Miles had only to pass on the message the old
woman had given him over the low stone wall, on
his way to Glenbossie. In her Gaelic-spoken message
she had given him the eternally old message,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
and though he “had not Gaelic,” he had understood
it, because she had spoken in the universal
language. A lover’s language may be as new as the
morning; it is also as old as the hills. And that old
woman had not forgotten the days of her youth,
and why? Because the sun was in the heavens, by
day, to remind her: the stars in the sky at night:
the burn on the hillside: the heather on the moor:
the little children passing by—tender reminders,
these. Even the rain must re-awaken memories
of the enfolded plaid: the peat smoke bring back
memories of evenings when the day was past and
over, the harvest gathered in, and the bairns asleep.</p>

<p>As with Dick and his mother the parting lay
like a weight on the hearts of Miles and Diana.
When she said it would not be for long, he laughed.
She little knew how short a time it might be, or
that it rested with her to make it short or interminable.
He had promised to leave her when he had
seen her into the train which should take her on to
Loch Bossie and he saw her into that train. When
she asked him why he didn’t come on with her,
he said it was against orders. Against whose? she
wanted to know. He would not tell her. She asked
him if he should go south that night?</p>

<p>And he said he should go to Glenbossie by the
next train.</p>

<p>“Why not by this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>Because, he said, he had promised not to go by
her train unless something should happen to make
him alter his plans.</p>

<p>The dear old lady would have been more human
if she had not made this impossible condition, he
thought, but she had made it.</p>

<p>“Diana?” he said.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“You have never told me.”</p>

<p>“No—”</p>

<p>“Won’t you?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. There wasn’t time—it
would take years—the train was going—it was
off—Miles was left on the platform.</p>

<p>Then Diana looked out of the carriage window,
smiled at him, and drew back—and with one
stride Miles was on the step of the guard’s van—</p>

<p>Having made friends with the guard, which was
not difficult, he sat down to write to Mrs. Sloane.
He sat on a stout wooden box, which, according to
the label, belonged to one Christina MacDonald.
He hoped Christina was as happy as he was.
She must be: perhaps she had gone from London
and was going home. From London to Scotland.
Happy Christina! Perhaps she was going home to
be married! Dear Christina! He loved her, as he
loved every one in the world that morning. But he
must write his letter: he wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>

<p>“I am in the guard’s van. The circumstances
proved quite exceptional—I did not make them
so—and the separation was more than I could
bear. Now that I am near her I am absurdly
happy, because I believe she is a little unhappy
because—she thinks—I am not near her. I saw
her into this train, as I promised, and just as the
train was going out of the station she popped her
beautiful little head out of the window and smiled
at me—I thought I saw tears in her eyes! Do I
stand exonerated? How can I thank you? I shall
never be able to. There is so much I want to say
and I am too shy to say it. Why need I say anything
to you who understand everything? But I
feel in honour bound to explain to you why I am
in the guard’s van—you must have known I
should be there! As a boy I thought it the best
place on the train—now I know one better!”</p>

hand on hers, and she smiled.</p>
